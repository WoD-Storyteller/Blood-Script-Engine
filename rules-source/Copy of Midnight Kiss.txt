                 Midnight Kiss
                                A Story for Vampire: The Masquerade

                                                                New Year, New You!


                           You’re trying to survive as one of the Kindred night to night, dealing with the sects, the
                        hunters, your own fading connection to the mortal world you used to inhabit. Ask yourself: Is
                        this all it’s ever going to be? It’s New Year’s Eve and as the city around you celebrates, you’re
                                                faced with another twelve months of the same old.


                        Unless you have a choice. You have received an invitation from the Nephilim, the Children of
                         the Angel, to attend a New Year’s celebration at their temple. A mysterious, glamorous and
                        powerful vampiric cult, they’re opening their doors to the Kindred of the city, providing a rare
                                                   chance to marvel at the wonders within.


                        During the festivities, you’re offered a chance to be part of something greater. Will you accept at the
                                     cost of your humanity or greet the new year with your principles intact?

                                   Vampire: The Masquerade addresses the darkness in the real
                                   world through horror stories. This story includes in-world references and
                                   expressions of the following: addiction, violence, abduction, ritualistic
                                   murder, religious abuse, sexual situations, and death.

                                   If this story isn’t part of an established chronicle and the players don’t
                                   have time to make their own characters, we’ve provided you with a co-
                                   terie of six ready-to-play vampires. They’re a newly established Que-
                                   stari coterie (see Vampire, p. 199). The coterie’s a blend of thin-blood-
                                   ed and true vampires.

                 The mausoleum is empty save for Albertine. She’s
            held to the concrete floor with metal restraints and
            chains. Weeks of blood draining have made her more
            animal than Kindred.
                 Freeing her is a Dexterity + Larceny test (Difficulty
            3) to unlock her restraints and a Strength + Athletics test
            (Difficulty 2) to pull off the chains. Doing this while she’s
            starving increases the Difficulty of each test by 1, and
            failure puts the character at risk of her Kiss.
                 Albertine only needs to slake the equivalent of 1
            Hunger to achieve a ravenous but lucid state.

                 Pulling away from the Kiss of an elder is dangerous.

                 A character who feeds Albertine receives +1 Hunger
            and must make a Resolve + Brawl test at Difficulty 4 to
            shove her away. A failure adds an additional Hunger level
            as she continues to drain the Kindred. The character may
            roll multiple times, the Difficulty reducing by 1 after each
            failure until the character either wins or falls into torpor.
                 If Morgan is present, he’ll volunteer to feed
            Albertine. Unless the coterie saves him with a Strength +
            Stamina test at Difficulty 4, she drains him to final death.
                 If the three hunters are present, they won’t volunteer.
            If Emilio is with them, he recognizes Albertine from
            Tomas’s teachings. He rushes to her with a cry of joy and
            offers himself to her. The hunters will try to stop him.
                 A fed and free Albertine is the epitome of beauty,
            manners, and grace. She thanks the coterie and apologizes
            for any mess. She leaves the mausoleum through a
            passageway to confront Tomas at midnight (p. 24). She
            won’t offer the coterie to join her but will let them
            accompany her if they decide to do so.
                 If Albertine is free and unfed, she’ll attack the closest
            character. If she can’t do that, she rushes to the mausoleum
            door. The guard will open the door and if he isn’t saved,
            he’s murdered. She dashes into the halls and goes on an
            indiscriminate feeding frenzy. If the coterie wants to find
            her, she’ll be in a dressing room in the south wing of the
            Transepts, cleaning copious amounts of blood off her face.
