  Introduction




                 Introduction:

                 O pening Ga mbits
                    “For behold, the day is coming, that shall burn like a furnace. And all the proud, yes, all
                  who do evil will be as straw in it. And the day which is coming shall burn them up,” says the
                  LORD of Hosts. “Neither root nor branch will be left of them.”
                     ― M A L ACH I 4:1




                  A
                                  n unnamed Toreador coined the term “the Second Inquisition” for the shitstorm that’s de-
                                  servedly raining down on the Kindred right now. It is, literally, a term of art, not a specific
                                  referent: you can’t call the Second Inquisition on the phone, or email them @si.gov. (Although
                                  if you do send email to that domain name, somebody reads it …) Nobody has “Second Inquisi-
                  tion” letterhead or a cool SI logo. Even the Vatican just considers this the same Inquisition as the one they
                  started in the 13th century, only the fires blaze higher (and higher-tech) now as the end times near.
                      Think of the Second Inquisition as an event rather than an organization in itself. This is the time of the
                  Second Inquisition, a new burning time when the Masquerade frays and the Kindred need once more fear
                  the kine. In these nights, vampire-hunting factions of all sizes (and levels of funding and preparation) come
                  together and strike a fire.
                      The most salient iteration of the Second Inquisition, and what the Kindred usually mean by that phrase,
                  is the illicit and covert multinational conspiracy within many intelligence services and the Vatican to hunt
                  vampires. That group calls itself “the Coalition,” when it refers to its membership unofficially. (Officially, it
                  doesn’t exist.) Even that oversimplifies matters: in practice, the Coalition comprises two overlapping con-
                  spiratorial alliances, a major third force, and a number of clandestine local programs that all sometimes share
                  targeting information.
                      This book focuses on those hunters and their hunt, because that particular exemplar of the Second
                  Inquisition poses by far the most danger to Kindred society as a whole. But one neighborhood church group
                  or union local with a stake lathe in the garage can destroy you just as truly as a centuries-old Vatican militant
                  society or a deniable DEVGRU strike team can.

            Use this Book                                                Like most worldwide phenomena, the Second In-

            This is a book of antagonists for Vampire: The               and spy stories often resemble each other more

                 unmarked cars or sniper’s nests or the crowd you
                 thought to hunt in safely. And then they close in,

            HOLY GROUND
            Some places absorb the spiritual energy of the devout for so long or so intensely that they begin radiating it
            back. Locations of major miracles or significant martyrdoms can become holy ground overnight. These sites
            may come from any religious tradition and may be located anywhere. Storytellers may choose to make for-
            gotten sites (a standing stone, a buried church) linger on in holiness.
                True Holy Ground has a rating from one to five dots. Interpolate the specific Holy Ground values for loca-
            tions in your chronicle city from the following:
            • Neighborhood religious building, consecrated graveyard
            •• Large mosque, cathedral, temple, or synagogue
            ••• Venerated Site: Mt. Athos, Blue Mosque, tomb of a saint or imam, Six Grandfathers in the Black Hills,
            South Dakota
            •••• Major Holy Site: Notre Dame Cathedral (Paris), Dakshineswar (Kolkata), Al-Kadhimiya Mosque
            (Baghdad), Mount Kurama (near Kyōto), Wudāng Temple Complex in Húbě (China), Uluru in the Northern
            Territory (Australia)
            ••••• Holy of Holies: Wailing Wall, Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Dome of the Rock (all Jerusalem), Kaaba
            (Mecca), Dashashwamedh Ghat (Varanasi), Mount Kailāsa (Himalayas), palace of the Oòni in Ilé-Ifè ̣ (Nigeria)
                Holy Ground has no mechanical effect on vampires or other supernatural creatures (except those with the
            appropriate Folkloric Block Flaw (Corebook, p. 182)), although it may make them uneasy or irritated. Until,
            that is, someone with True Faith stands on it; at such times, the Faithful adds the dots of the Holy Ground to
            their own True Faith.
                If the Faithful comes from a different tradition from the Ground (a Catholic priest in a Hindu temple, for
            example), they generally cannot add Holy Ground to their Faith. Other activities (having a running gunfight in
            a Buddhist stupa, for instance) might interfere with such addition. Storytellers must determine whether an
            individual Faithful and a specific piece of Holy Ground are compatible, and if so how much.
                Vampires, especially in the Sabbat, may seek to desecrate holy ground. The specifics of those rituals or
            activities remain in the Storyteller’s hands but they generally involve a contest (Resolve + Occult, for exam-
            ple) vs. Holy Ground + True Faith of its most Faithful defender. Add a die to the vampires’ pool for every Stain
            incurred in the attempt; if the Faithful wins, each vampire takes 1 Aggravated damage for each extra success.

                   LAST RESORTS
                        As the Gehenna War heats up, the Five Torches can’t help but stoke the flames. These aircraft seldom
                   appear over Western cities, but as Vienna demonstrated, “seldom” doesn’t mean “never.” We don’t pro-
                   vide damage or armor values for these apocalyptic weapons systems, because if it’s come to ground zero,
                   it’s too late.
                   AC-130 SPECTRE GUNSHIP
                        Retired from active military service by the United States, these massive C-130 cargo planes mount two
                   20mm M61 Vulcan cannons, one L60 Bofors 40mm cannon, and an M137 105mm cannon. With the ability to
                   circle targets for hours, the AC-130 brings precise and deadly close air support onto the battlefield. IAO con-
                   spirators saved a handful of these gunships from retirement and loaded them with incendiary ammunition and
                   ultraviolet dazzle lasers. FIRSTLIGHT deploys them against blankbody concentrations in active war zones and
                   deniable areas. Only the most powerful supernatural creatures can survive their onslaught.
                   B-2 SPIRIT STEALTH BOMBER
                        Arguably the most powerful tool in the Second Inquisition’s arsenal. The B-2 requires special care for
                   IAO to bring to bear against blankbodies since their actions are closely monitored and this risks exposing the
                   FIRSTLIGHT conspiracy to the world. The B-2 can carry almost any compliment of high-yield bombs, but it is
                   the twin GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator deliveries that make it the trump card in FIRSTLIGHT’s
                   hand. These weapons can tunnel deep beneath the surface and devastate the most fortified crypts, caverns,
                   or buried ziggurats.

                   requires an entire blood transfusion: emptying the
                   victim’s veins and refilling them with fresh blood.
                   The process leaves the blankbody in torpor for 24
                   hours after completion. Kindred can also deliber-
                   ately starve themselves at Hunger 5 for two days,
                   emptying themselves completely of blood. This, of
                   course, has its own dangers.

                   Necrophage Cocktail
                   Necrophagic parasites devour a dead body from the
                   inside out, an excellent remedy for a powerful foe
                   you would prefer not to fight directly. Once admin-
                   istered, the victim makes a Stamina + Stamina test
                   each night on rising. If they fail, they take one level
                   of Aggravated damage. Necrophages remain active
                   for 6 minus Stamina weeks.

                   GPS Chips
                   Normal intelligence and law enforcement agencies
                   don’t have access to implantable GPS chips yet (the
                   on-market solutions are too big, and battery life is
                   a problem), but FIRSTLIGHT and JTRG (and
                   many other Western agencies) do. Small enough
                   to implant in a blankbody, GPS chips leave only
                   the tiniest red welt at the implant site — and on a
                   blankbody, that mark heals quickly. Blankbodies
                   who come back from FIRSTLIGHT or comparable
                   facilities should assume they’ve been chipped. Some
                   teams carry “stingers” the size of an ear-piercing gun
                   to implant chips on subjects in the field.
                       Implanting a GPS chip with a stinger requires
                   a Dexterity + Medicine roll (Difficulty 1); a con-
                   scious, unwilling subject can contest that roll
                   with Wits + Alertness to notice that something
                   more than a regular injection just happened. After
                   implant, an Intelligence + Medicine roll (Difficulty
                   4) spots the implant site, after which a Dexterity +
                   Medicine roll (Difficulty 2) removes it. A success-
                   fully implanted GPS chip gives +2 successes on tests
                   to locate a subject.

                   Phased Motion Detector (Screamers)
                   Blankbodies have an uncanny ability to sneak up
                   on a mortal, disappear from plain sight — or hide
                   there, and generally act like creeps. Phased motion

            Supposedly carved from the claw of a werewolf, this
            cruelly hooked dagger measures a little under six
            inches from tip to ivory pommel. Usually, leather
            windings prevent the wielder from gashing their
            palm on it.

              the full moon, the wielder can sense any Kindred
              within three meters of them. Werewolves can also
              sense such a blade, and want to take it back from
              its human desecrator.

            Waxen Poetica
            The SAD locked samples of this dangerous red
            wax in their vault over five decades ago as part of
            an unsolved murder investigation with suspected
            supernatural involvement. The SAD reopened the
            case recently when a vampire calling themselves “the
            poet” left another burned victim encased in this
            living wax. While the original samples remain in the
            vault, some of the wax from the second crime scene
            has been cleared for field use.
                The wax “comes alive” when exposed to blood,
            so SAD agents keep it in fragile two-chamber can-
            isters that mix the two components when broken.
            When the wax touches blood it boils and grows to
            cover anything it touches until it’s exhausted the
            blood supply and rapidly cools back into its inert
            form, usually living behind a victim boiled alive and
            covered in the unnerving substance.

                more subtle the effects). The first three rolls are
                one week apart, and subsequent rolls one day
                apart.

                three times the blankbody’s Herd rating. Each
                point of Fame the target blankbody has adds 1
                die to the Analyst’s pool, but each point of Influ-

            put, torture is revolting and shocking. It elicits extreme reactions, and sometimes a horror story requires ex-
            tremes. Torture also identifies the villains of the story. Player characters face moral and ethical choices while
            burdened with a monstrous nature – those same choices can break or corrupt mortals, plunging them into
            depravity without the excuse of the Beast. Second Inquisition torture signals to players that evil also exists
            outside of their own afflictions.

            VAMPIRES AS VICTIMS
                Depictions of torture remain best reserved for off-screen moments and implied threats. For outcomes
            against player characters, use the system in the Corebook (p. 415). Ideally, the rest of the coterie can break
            the captured Kindred out of the transport plane or holding pen before things get to that point. That said,
            to clarify the kind of violence the Coalition allows itself to use against humans and vampires alike, here we
            present a non-exhaustive list of techniques adapted by the Coalition from their patrons’ previous experiences
            in Chechnya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Ireland, and elsewhere.
                Despite their pursuit, study and extermination of vampires, many hunters only have limited understand-
            ing of their weaknesses. Since torture is a blunt instrument, this generally confines their torture methods to
            three implements.

            FIRE AND FEAR
                Coalition assets likely discovered blankbodies’ phobia of fire during the first confused missions in 2002.
            Over the next two decades, FIRSTLIGHT and GRU psychologists slowly built a working theory of operant
            conditioning, using everything from brands and heated pokers to thermal lances to slowly convince their pris-
            oners of their helplessness. (De-fanging a target with dental pliers contributes mightily to this reaction, when
            it happens.) This doesn’t make fiery threats any more reliable than other tortures, of course.

            SUNBOARDING
                “Sunboarding,” as FIRSTLIGHT torturers euphemistically call it, is any scenario that uses the sun’s light to
            threaten vampires with death. Just as interrogators use waterboarding to threaten a victim with drowning, in-
            quisitors weaponize sunlight to terrify vampires with grievous wounds or even death until they talk. This usually
            entails restraining a vampire and allowing thin beams of reflected sunlight to advance towards them until they
            comply or are burned. The restraints are often basic, but particularly sadistic hunters have invented iron maid-
            en-like devices to entrap their victims in a sarcophagus that can let in small beams of sunlight as needed. Keep-
            ing a vampire awake during the daytime and out of frenzy are the most complicated aspects of this procedure.

            BLOOD DEPRIVATION
                One thing the Coalition does know about vampires is that they hunger for blood. While they may not real-
            ize how constant or urgent the hunger is for most vampires, they do know that depriving a blankbody causes
            them extreme discomfort and pain. This is a slow but relatively safe method of torture from the hunter’s
            perspective. The hunters are less familiar with the particulars of frenzy, but a starving vampire will tell you
            anything you want to hear for a drop of blood. Some torturers leave a saucer of blood just out of reach of a
            restrained or locked up vampire for days, unable to reach it as it slowly spoils and clots in front of their eyes.
            Others bleed the vampire slowly, allowing the hunger to fill the void left behind.
                The blankbody’s Hunger rapidly increases by 1 for each success on the interrogator’s Manipulation +
            Medicine roll. At Hunger 5, the blankbody tests for a Compulsion as if they had suffered a bestial failure. 1-9
            results in Hunger, 0 in the clan compulsion. For a Caitiff or thin-blood, don’t roll: the result is always Hunger.
            A blankbody under this compulsion will do or say anything to sate their appetite, and the Interrogator is quick
            to offer a blood bag.




                                                                  103

            Gentrification
            The Coalition team moves against the characters’
            Domain and power base if any. Severing access
            to Havens and contact networks should force
            the characters into a rash offensive or a weakened
            defense; either way, the Coalition can more easily
            confront them.

            Deprogramming
            If the Coalition team has identified the characters
            (or their ghouls) as potential assets, they target one
            or more of them for deprogramming and recruit-
            ment. Thin-blood characters often receive this kind
            of attention.

  Chapter Four: Fire Teams




                    THE HEARTBEAT ALGORITHM
                        The IAO grew out of a desire to more effectively share and filter collected intelligence across the entirety
                    of the U.S. intelligence community. Part of the reason behind why a small organization hidden on the back
                    pages of an Intelligence Community flow chart has gained so much power lies in an algorithm known by the
                    codename Heartbeat. Heartbeat was at first only a piece of the IAO strategy that collected data streams
                    from various agencies such as the CIA, DIA, and NSA. That a great deal of that data was initially obtained il-
                    legally also meant that Heartbeat was only accessible to a select few. Now Heartbeat sifts through the never-
                    ending waterfall of ECHELON’s real time global data streams looking for evidence of vampiric and other
                    supernatural activity.
                        GPS trackers, photo sharing sites, WiFi doorbell cameras, police stingray collections, fitness app biometric
                    data, smartphone cameras and facial recognition software are all Heartbeat’s unwitting accomplices in a never
                    ending hunt for blankbodies. Just as the U.S. government can identify a practicing Muslim or a lapsed Catholic
                    by collecting enough of their private metadata, Heartbeat finds the commonalities in a blankbody’s digital
                    footprint. Long hours of daylight inactivity. Relatively no participation with supermarkets, pharmacies or
                    other businesses that sustain life. Frequent visitation to high risk or low information environments with above
                    average missing persons or assault statistics, and so on.
                        FIRSTLIGHT has repeatedly attempted to take over control of Heartbeat from the IAO, but just as FIRST-
                    LIGHT wants its own covert strike force, the IAO wants its own intelligence gathering system. Generally, the
                    two agree to share raw Heartbeat product, but it’s not entirely unknown for certain profiles to build up in
                    Pearl Harbor well before they show up on monitors in Langley and Fort Meade. With foreign actors, the IAO
                    proves even stingier with Heartbeat intel. JTRG’s pipeline into GCHQ allows them to offer some degree of
                    parity, and the Society of St. Leopold can usually get what it wants in exchange for a few relics in a Philippine
                    cathedral. However, recent political tensions make the IAO reluctant to share anything beyond the most ur-
                    gent intelligence with their Russian partners. While the IAO claims they need to prevent supernatural entities
                    gaining access to Heartbeat feeds from third parties, most within the Coalition suspect it has more to do with
                    how the data is collected. Sharing too much could allow their partners to reverse engineer the exploits and
                    backdoors used by the U.S. intelligence community to gather this information in the first place.
                        Vampires fight the battle against Heartbeat every second of their unlife. Every hurried phone call or un-
                    covered ATM camera photo creates a potential data point for Heartbeat to exploit. Most Camarilla domains
                    have taken to withdrawing from technology almost completely and reverting to Cold War methods of covert
                    communication with messengers leaving notes in dead drops and encoded in lost Napoleonic cyphers. An-
                    archs and other vampires use more direct countermeasures. Destroying street cameras, using burner phones,
                    disguising their features, and targeting local law enforcement for revenge attacks. But in the end Heartbeat
                    always wins, building an identifying pattern out of countermeasures and acts of defiance alike. In a perverse
                    self-fulfilling prophecy, only toppling or dominating the IAO itself would put an end to the world’s foremost
                    digital vampire hunter.

            ALPHABET INQUISITIONS
                While FIRSTLIGHT is a conspiracy within a conspiracy, not every vampire hunter in the US government
            (USG) knows it exists or operates under its control. As the Camarilla hunkers down, their precious Mas-
            querade has all but collapsed in some parts of the United States. This has created a scattered awakening to
            the truth about vampires within various departments of the USG. Disorganized, unsure and poorly informed,
            these vampire hunters can not bring the same kind of trouble to bear against a coterie but they are often
            more in tune with their local community and dealing with them too harshly could attract the attention of
            “real” hunters.
            ICE
                Heavily militarized and able to freely operate on both sides of the US border, Immigration and Customs
            Enforcement (ICE) is an organization deeply penetrated by FIRSTLIGHT conspirators because of its focus on
            transnational crimes, but ICE has grown so large that even FIRSTLIGHT is unaware that they’re not the only
            ones using ICE resources to hunt for vampires. As the agency responsible for rounding up and deporting un-
            documented immigrants, ICE agents are experts at breaching homes and holding large numbers of prisoners.
            Their mandate also grants them the extraordinary power to interrogate and detain anyone within 100 miles
            of a US border: roughly 75% of the population of the USA. Independent vampire hunters in ICE find easy ac-
            cess to heavy weapons and an institutional culture that places a premium on following orders. Vampires that
            run afoul of hunters within ICE enjoy the classic paramilitary experience, complete with assault rifles, batter-
            ing rams, flexi-cuffs and tear gas canisters.
            DEA
                Another agency penetrated by FIRSTLIGHT loyalists, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is a
            strange mixture within the USG, combining both paramilitary and intelligence gathering expertise. While
            similar to ICE in that its mandate concerns illegal material crossing over the US border, the DEAs singular
            focus on illegal drugs has also allowed it to expand its operations into over sixty foreign countries where nar-
            cotics and other illegal drugs are either produced or trafficked. Unlike ICE, the DEA has a corporate culture
            more focused on criminal investigation as opposed to kinetic operations and corrections. While DEA agents
            have access to small arms, they often work with allied militaries when abroad and local police within the US.
            Hunters operating out of the DEA would have access to very high end surveillance equipment including wire
            taps, directional microphones, tracking microdots and stingrays capable of intercepting cellular calls and
            texts. Particularly motivated DEA hunters could even use their knowledge of local criminal organizations or
            cartels to frame the vampires as potential rivals and targets.
            CDC
                While it would seem that an organization concerned with biohazards and contagious threats would have
            more than its fair share of vampire hunters, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) is a relatively small and
            underfunded agency that sits outside the USG’s military-intelligence complex. The few independent vam-
            pire hunters that do operate out of the CDC have formed a secret working group of researchers known as
            ECLIPSE. They are primarily concerned with how vampirism spreads and in the development of a vaccine that
            would immunize humans against the embrace and stop blankbodies from reproducing altogether. ECLIPSE re-
            searchers are constantly in need of blankbody blood and tissue samples and readily trade narcotics and other
            restricted substances to obtain them. It’s rumored that at least one cell of freed ghouls and amateur hunters
            makes a living supplying ECLIPSE with the parts they need.

  Chapter Four: Fire Teams




                    COG AND THE DEEP STATE
                         He calls himself Cog and he claims to be a whistleblower working for the shadowy deep state that controls
                    several world governments through blackmail, blood magic and an ancient pact with moon aliens. While he
                    offers no proof for any of these wild assertions, Cog lays out his manifesto in a series of cryptic and riddle
                    filled essays that are still widely shared all over the dark web. Originally posted under the name incognito as
                    a series of screenshots on a Youtube channel dedicated to UFO Robot Grendizer, Cog laid the blame for mul-
                    tiple terrorist attacks in Europe and Asia on face stealing vampires working for the deep state. Of the many
                    conspiracy theories that have gained traction in the popular mind, Cog’s in particular has drawn a cult like
                    following from a wide swath of Americans trying to explain their own government’s seemingly inexplicable
                    actions.
                         The cracks in the Masquerade have grown as vampires have become politically fractured and all but openly
                    hunted. While many world governments involved in the Coalition do their best to cover what traces of the
                    supernatural they can, the dark web has allowed rumors to spread to a populace ill-prepared to tell truth
                    from fiction. Unable to square their reality with the story provided by the media, many turn to these con-
                    spiracy theories to answer their questions. Why are their city’s crumbling while fleets of armed drones patrol
                    the world’s skies? Why are their politicians unable to fight for them but so quick to go to war overseas? Why
                    won’t anyone just tell them what the hell is going on?
                         Cog has filled that gap with a strange and disjointed story hidden in a virtual easter egg hunt spread across
                    multiple websites and USB geocaches. While the first few pages of his manifesto were made public they were
                    incomplete, but between the lines were clues to where the rest of his story could be found. Each time a new
                    piece of the manifesto is unearthed, his followers spend days pouring over the text and any accompanying
                    drawings in hopes of finding clues to the next puzzle. According to Cog a great spiritual war is already being
                    fought in the shadows and the dark corners of the Earth. All people, but Americans in particular, have a holy
                    obligation to arm themselves in this conflict against these infernal forces.
                         In his later posts Cog even details the various strengths and weaknesses of several vampire families, as
                    well as a method for interstellar communication through mirrors. The vampires and moon aliens aside, the
                    ultimate mystery his followers hope to discover is Cog’s identity. Since Cog uses the terms “flavor country”
                    and “my delicious American brothers” so often in his manifesto, many believe he’s the host of a discontinued
                    cooking reality show turned CIA agent or possibly one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Others suspect the culinary
                    turns of phrases may actually hint at why the vampires have aligned themselves with the shadow government.

                    THE ARCANUM
                        The Arcanum have kept their involvement in the Second Inquisition strictly secret and have only estab-
                    lished direct channels in the UK with the Newburgh Group and SO13’s commander Khan. Occult scholars and
                    dilettantes with a long history of studying and battling against the supernatural, several prominent members
                    of the English elite are counted among the Arcanum’s secret membership. Their influence is partially respon-
                    sible for the formation of the JTRG and they provide what mystical support they can to SO13’s headhunter
                    squads. While not as rich in occult artifacts as the Vatican or even the FBI’s SAD, the Arcanists represent
                    arguably the most organized force of practical sorcerers in Europe. Their expertise was vital in locating and
                    defeating the magical defenses of the Vienna nest and the subsequent scouring of the ruins for valuables.
                    While Arcanum libraries did profit from that attack, the Vatican soldiers on the ground claimed most of the
                    mystical spoils.
                        On an operational level Arcanists provide support through briefings on esoteric threats and occasionally
                    by using ritual magic to shape the battlefields. This support is done covertly and by request only, so as to hide
                    their involvement from soldiers who might be captured or enslaved by blankbodies. While they won’t admit
                    this to their allies, the Arcanum’s magical powers are very limited in comparison to the capabilities of blank-
                    bodies. The exact nature of their magic is unknown, but for the most part they’ve demonstrated an ability to
                    divine mystically hidden locations and undo magical wards.

            The Masquerade was never well kept on the island nation and now it has all but unravelled in the face of the
            vampire hunters of the Toussaint Brigade. Haiti’s hunters grew out of a decentralized youth network origi-
            nally organized in service of a national strike. Haitian Kindred responded brutally to this threat to their power
            base but despite murdering several professors and public intellectuals in the movement’s leadership the teen-
            age protesters continued their campaign. Overburdened by the protests the state could no longer carry out
            the Kindred’s will and a few vampires began to openly use their powers to cow the population back to work.
            Soon afterward, the young rebels organized into cells and began hunting for vampires. Unable to effectively
            wield the security services against them, neonates and ancillae fled Haiti en masse and left their sleeping
            elders to their fate.

            JAPAN
                Long thought a relatively safe place for Kindred to conduct business, Japan has seen an influx of vampires
            looking for a safe haven to ride out the Second Inquisition. While overcrowding had made feeding more diffi-
            cult, it was only the brutal murder of Tokyo’s Prince by heavily armed amateur “D-Club” hunters that alerted
            the Kindred that Japan’s Masquerade was no longer intact. While multiple Kindred now claim to rule the city,
            the court is eager to crown anyone who deals with the hunters the rightful Prince.

            of conspiracy theorists in the bud.

            photographs, local urban legends, and any other

            are thousands. The law of averages dictates that

                    RANDOM RAIDS
                        With everything else the Storyteller has to keep track of, running an occupation can get lost in the weeds.
                    Once every game month, launch a Coalition operation: a raid, a successfully gentrified Domain, a targeted ter-
                    mination, something that reminds the players of the threat. Depending on your chronicle city’s geography you
                    might have a place in mind, or you can determine the target randomly.
                        Most paper maps (and many online ones) have grids overlaying them, as a location key. If not, it’s easy
                    enough to draw a ten-by-ten grid on a printed or Xeroxed map. Roll two dice and send the hunters to the
                    location indicated, re-rolling if you get an impossible target like the middle of the lake. If you want another
                    metric, make an Investigation roll for the local Coalition planner (Bear-Leader, p. 23) and use the result to
                    determine the danger and damage to the local Kindred. A critical on that roll targets the Primogen or the
                    main Anarch gang.
                        As the occupation intensifies, launch the operations more frequently: once every three game weeks,
                    then once every two game weeks. A once-per-week pace indicates the Coalition has surged into the city, or
                    believes they have almost won; they likely slacken again after three or so straight weeks of major operations.
                    Coterie action can also shift the frequency of attacks: if they anger the occupiers, attacks step up; if they baf-
                    fle or bluff them, the Coalition stands down a bit.

            THE SUPERWEAPON
                The superweapon has remained a core element, possibly the core element, of the technothriller story
            ever since Jules Verne invented the subgenre. Robur’s Terror becomes the Soviets’ Red October becomes Hy-
            dra’s INSIGHT Helicarriers. The antagonists build it, and threaten the world with it; the heroes then destroy
            or steal it. Adding a superweapon to a Vampire chronicle can provide the spine of a single story, or become
            the climax of the city-wide war. Potential SI superweapons include:
            ■ The Red Gas (p. 82) is already a superweapon: weaponized holiness that fills a space like a gas but doesn’t
                disperse like one. Alternatively, consider a chemical weapon nanoengineered to be attracted to aero-

                through the obstacle and briefly light up the interior like the sun. Its capacitors take days to charge, and
                release their energy in one burst, but the improved models should come on line soon, just after a few
                more field tests … and the really big one they’re building in that isolated building on campus can blanket
                the city in a nanosecond, lighting up every interior surface at once.
            ■ A powerful rite that boils the vitae in anyone who hears it spoken. Of course, it’s in only one book, and in
                a dead language, but even a broken translation proves very effective. And every time the cantor speaks it,
                it gets clearer, as though Something wants it uttered.
            ■ A biological-alchemical weapon, the Litharge, deployed in the blood of innocent 20-something civilians
                through adulterated sports drinks. It acts on the Kindred like borax on ants, building up in their vitae and
                slowly starving them to death. Possible variants include a radioactive tracer so the Coalition can track them
                to their lair, or a final catalyst that triggers frenzy when enough infected Kindred gather in one place.
            ■ Just a really big tank, or deadly helicopter gunship, loaded down with “thermal lances” and Gatling cannon.
                Its armor invulnerable to anything short of a 105mm shell, its sensor package wrapped around target-
                ing XScopes, it spells true death to any haven it’s deployed against. All the Coalition needs is a big riot to
                justify bringing it out. This sort of superweapon makes more sense in a chronicle city already on the edge
                of (or in the middle of) a war zone, from whence the IAO or GRU diverts it from its mortal targets.

                 Whatever the superweapon, the story unfolds with hints and whispers. The characters hear of its build-
            ing; maybe they spot (or interfere with) a Burrower gathering needed materials or a UTR squad capturing a
            crucial designer. Perhaps they follow up and see it under construction, then get driven off by extraordinarily
            stiff defenses. Or their first glance of it comes as it destroys some other haven, or stomps some Anarch street
            gang. When it moves against them, they fight it and lose, the only survivors. Now they have only a few nights
            to find its weakness and destroy it, before the Coalition turns it loose on every Kindred in their city … and
            perhaps the whole world.

                    help for a while. If the coterie has a relatively non-

                    suspense themes that Second Inquisition stories
                    batten upon. When will the sudden and inevitable
