                                    he Blood is too good to waste on eternity. You live,

      INTRODUCTION                  you die, you live again, exploding into the night as
                                    a newly created animal desperately seeking to hide
                               among its former human peers.

                               You learn to lie, to hurt and to hunt.

                               You learn the bliss of tasting blood.

                               You learn to see every human being as a living mechanism
                               keeping your blood warm for you.

                               You want to exist in the here and now. You want to feel
                               everything the night can give you. You want to see what's
                               out there. Maybe you even want to belong.




                               The Anarchs
                               The old have the power, the knowledge and the resources to keep running things
                               to their advantage. The young have nothing but their fearlessness, numbers and an
                               understanding of the modern world.
                                   And that's just mortals. For vampires, it's much worse. The aged will never die.
                               They will hold on to their positions and advantages forever and ever, crushing eve-
                               ryone who might one day threaten their privileges.
                                   The War of Ages is the organizing principle of vampire society. Established
                               power has organized itself into the Camarilla, seeking to limit the very concept of
                               what a vampire can be. They seek to control the existence of every single vampire
                               on earth and to keep both the mortals and the undead in an eternal stasis where
                               power never changes hands.
                                   The Anarch Movement stands arrayed against the Camarilla. It consists of an
                               endless variety of ideologies and theories of power, brought together by an unwill-
                               ingness to spend an eternity in a static tyranny.
                                   The very first edition of Vampire: the Masquerade from 1991 has this quote
                               on the back cover: "No one holds command over me. No man. No god. No Prince.
                               What is a claim of age for ones who are immortal? What is a claim of power for
                               ones who defy death? Call your damnable hunt. We shall see who I drag screaming
                               to Hell with me."
                                   That's the core experience of playing an Anarch vampire, right there. You're a
                               young revolutionary fighting to destroy an immortal tyranny of blood. You're just
                               a nobody, someone off the streets who got caught up in the War of Ages and try-
                               ing to survive. You're an idealist torn between your dreams for a better world and
                               the bloodlust tainting everything you touch.

           The Experience
           This book seeks to lay out a wide variety of Anarch
           experiences, from the leather jacketed biker Anarchs
           of the Free States to the Duskborn party scene in
           Reykjavik. In all of these cases, the vampire lives in
           the now. Eternal life is but a distant dream in the
           nightly fight for survival, and many of the vampires
           who make up the Anarch scene would probably have
           lived longer if they had never become vampires at all.
               Vampire life among the Unbound is fast and
           deadly. You learn to take risks, fight for what you
           want and die rather than submit. The concepts and
           ideas in this book are tools for you to use when you
           make a game of your own. Use them, change them,

                                                            story and what's their agenda? How is the issue being framed? Who ben-

                                                            with power and distrust those without power. If you're a young vampire,

                     The City on the Sea
                     If you hang out in Anarch circles, and                             For others, Carthage was a benevolent vampire
                     particularly with political Anarchs, for any length            dictatorship. We took care of our human brothers
                     of time, there's one word you're bound to hear:                and sisters, ruling over them compassionately and
                     Carthage. So what does a North African city state              only taking the blood we needed to survive. Our
                     whose glory days were two thousand years ago have              immortality meant that we could exist among them
                     to do with our struggle today?                                 openly as a privileged, trusted elite.
                         Carthage is sometimes called the Third City, after             There are darker versions of the story as well.
                     the First and Second Cities of vampire legend. Most            We're vampires after all, and the humans are a mere
                     of those legends don't get a lot of traction in Anarch         herd. In this vision of Carthage, the city was a utopia
                     circles, but Carthage does. As the story goes, it was          for Kindred, a metropolis with a captive, controlled
                     the best and most successful attempt at creating a             population which understood its place. This Carthage
                     society where humans and vampires could live to-               was a place of enlightenment and peace, as long as
                     gether openly and in harmony. Although created long            you were one of us.
                     before the birth of the modern Anarch Movement, it                 So which of these is true? Usually what you
                     was our paradise on earth, and its fall still resounds         believe depends on what kind of a world you want to
                     through vampire history. For the Camarilla, Carthage           build. You choose the Carthage that works for you.
                     is a symbol of the impracticality of our ideas and the             All three versions share two ideas: Vampires living
                     supremacy of their vision for our existence, but for us        openly among humans, and using our power to create
                     it means precisely the opposite.                               the society we want to live in. From the charity of
                         Let's face it: The very existence of Carthage flies        those who believe us equal to humans to the brutality
                     in the face of centuries of Camarilla orthodoxy about          of those who believe humans to be a mere resource,
                     the Masquerade. It calls into question the most basic          our common trait is ambition. We believe we can
                     conception have of ourselves. After all, the Princes           make the world anew. We don't have to accept the
                     tell us that we're parasites who hide among humanity,          current conditions like the Camarilla cowards do.
                     piggybacking on their successes. Their dogma states                This is the true meaning of Carthage. The exact
                     that secrecy is safety and only fools dream of radical         historical reality doesn't matter. The point is that a
                     change in human society to improve our lives.                  better world is possible.
                         So how did they do it? How did these ancient,                  This is also the truth that the Camarilla desper-
                     mainly Brujah Kindred manage something that has                ately seeks to suppress. Both mortal and Kindred
                     rarely been even attempted since?                              history tells of a violent Carthaginian blood cult.
                         This is where things become difficult. There are           Children were sacrificed in mad rituals, their bones
                     very few written sources and our elders are notorious          collected in deranged ossuaries. You can ask the
                     liars when it comes to history. It's hard to say how           question, is this true? Was Carthage actually a city of
                     Carthage was really organized, but a lot of Movement           violent terror, with its Brujah masters feasting on the
                     Anarchs have their own ideas of how it was done.               blood of babies?
                         For some, Carthage was a peaceful utopia in                    Mortal historians of Carthage have long strug-
                     which humans and vampires lived as equals. We                  gled with a lack of proper records from Carthage
                     weren't predators or parasites, but rather enjoyed the         itself. Their sources of information are second-hand,
                     blood of our human brethren consensually. We ruled             usually Roman. And who waged a bitter war against
                     our city together, sharing the power and privilege             Carthage, ultimately destroying it?
                     without regard to who was a vampire and who wasn't.                That's right, Rome.

           After all, children died of disease
           and hunger in Carthage the same
           as all across the ancient world.
               Still, it's no wonder the
           Camarilla still tries to tarnish the
           reputation of Carthage. The idea
           of the city has always been dan-
           gerous. Two thousand years ago, it
           was Brujah idealists in Carthage
           versus Ventrue conservatives in
           Rome. The Ventrue understood
           the potential of the Carthaginian
           idea to create a new revolutionary
           society. They realized that they
           had no place in this new world
           Carthage represented and decided
           they had to destroy it.
               From human history, it's hard
           to say why Carthage really fell.
           Maybe Roman military might
           supported by Ventrue wealth and
           power was enough. Or maybe
           Carthage had run into trouble on
           its own. Corruption is no stranger
           to us, so it's possible the Brujah of
           that time grew complacent and
           caused their own fall. Whatever
           the truth, Carthage laid the foun-
           dation for a pattern that would
           be repeated many times in our
           history. The city fell, but the idea
           became immortal.
               Sometimes we become so
           enamored of the story that we
           forget its basis in reality. In the
           grand legend of Carthage it was
           destroyed for all eternity, but

           Ten Nights that
           Shook the World

                                  or the duration of a single human lifetime, the Soviet Union existed as paradise
                                  on earth. Before you object to that statement, I ask you to consider paradise for
                                  whom?
                                       The Camarilla and its Kindred like to see themselves as separate from hu-
                           man history and society. This view of themselves makes it hard for Camarilla Kindred
                           to understand other ways of relating to humanity. They imagine that their framework is
                           universal, when in reality it's only shared by a small minority of aged vampires.
                               This is important if you wish to understand who we really were, the Brujah who par-
                           ticipated in the October Revolution.
                               Simply put, we were ordinary people. We were young, recently Embraced vampires,
                           none older than ten years undead. The Embrace doesn't erase who you are. Your history,
                           values, analysis of the world, class background. All of this survives intact. The only differ-
                           ence is that when the world starts to shake, you're better equipped to fight for what you
                           believe in.


                           The People
                           There was a lot of blood in the revolution, and it fueled a cleansing of society that would
                           have been unimaginable before. For the mortals, the blood they spilled gave them faith
                           they could succeed. For us, it sustained us as we tore apart the lairs of monsters so ancient,
                           even a Camarilla elder would tremble at the mention of their names.
                               The individualists of the Camarilla do not grasp the power of collective action. What
                           chance a methuselah has when the masses dismantle its tomb stone by stone in the cold
                           October sunlight? The mortals might think they're searching for provisions hidden away
                           by corrupt aristocrats, but the effect on the body of the vampire is the same. It will burn.
                               In those early nights, we were all united by the common purpose of destroying the rule
                           of the Tsar and the vampire Princes reigning in the night. We wanted to build something
                           better, something more, a beautiful new world by the people and for the people.
                               Perhaps the seeds of our division had already been planted, or perhaps our ideas
                           diverged only later. It doesn't really matter. In the beginning, we were fired up by the
                           knowledge we were doing something the old establishment had always told us was impos-

                     infiltrated their ranks as well, and we don't
                     always even have to work for it. The simple
                     truth is that in Camarilla cities where el-
                     ders routinely abuse their childer, there are
                     plenty of young vampires who leak informa-
                     tion to us. This is the typical Anarch spy in
                     a Camarilla Court: Someone who wants to
                     reclaim a little of their dignity by working
                     against their masters.
                         Sometimes we get fancy and send a
                     more experienced Anarch into a Camarilla
                     city as part of an operation, but this is rare.
                     Our strength is as a movement, not as a
                     paramilitary operation.

                     Overpopulation and Wights
                     Almost all Anarch domains are overpopu-
                     lated, but they also tend to have a very
                     high turnover of our kind. It’s a rarely
                     stated fact that the rate of degeneration
                     among newly Embraced Anarchs are sky
                     high. A significant percentage of our kind
                     succumb to the Beast within their first
                     few months of unlife. I suspect this is rarer
                     in Camarilla territories because of their
                     strict tutoring of their childer, but for us
                     it’s a good reminder that our ways aren’t
                     as perfect as our propaganda makes them
                     out to be. Some Barons appoint special
                     task forces to take care of these so-called
                     wights, but most domains expect their
                     licks to deal with their own problem
                     childer. After all, nothing attracts the
                     attention of the Second Inquisition like a
                     blood-crazed corpse on a rampage.

           He was half dead by the time we got to the roadhouse they were using as
           a place to sleep. They left him on the roof to wait for the sun.

               You know what I said to those Rabble? Nothing. I slept safe while

                     as an offering to the Lord in front of the tabernacle            that to find salvation they must sacrifice their blood
                     of the Lord - that person shall be considered guilty of          on the altar, or the blood of someone they love. This
                     bloodshed.”                                                      is the lesson of Isaac and Abraham, this is why they
                         Do you see? God considers blood to be sacred. He             give their children for us to eat. When an innocent

                     The Parasite Way
                     Agata: So basically you’re a tapeworm.

                     Rudi: Stop calling me a tapeworm. It’s beyond insulting.

                     Agata: I’m serious. You’re a parasite infesting a body. You’re living inside
                     an organism, growing at the expense of your host.

                     Rudi: You’re too cynical about this. We have a lot of options...

                     Agata: Maybe the tapeworm is the wrong analogy. You know that Amazonian fun-
                     gus which will take over an ant and start controlling it?

                     Rudi: First I’m a tapeworm and now I’m a fungus. There’s a reason nobody
                     likes you, Agata.

                     Agata: Okay, I got a better one. You’re a hormone. Like a substance that
                     blends into the normal operations of the body, subtly directing its actions.

                     Rudi: I think we have a serious messaging problem. When you go to the Ca-
                     marilla, they tell you that you’re one of the Kindred, an eternal secret
                     society of hidden masters shepherding humanity on its winding course through
                     history. When you come to us, we tell you that you’re a tapeworm. Or a fun-
                     gus.

                     Agata: I thought the hormone analogy was good.

                     Rudi: Nobody wants to be a hormone. Don’t be stupid.

                     Agata: Talk to me like that again and I’ll kill you.

                     Rudi: <silence>

                     Agata: Come on, it was a joke! Why do people always overreact when I threat-
                     en to kill them?

                     Rudi: I’m not going to answer that. But we got to consider our message. We
                     need to give our kind something they can believe in. Something to make them
                     proud.

                     Agata: I’m a proud tapeworm.

                     Rudi: You’re a lick, a bloodsucker, a vampire. Like me, you live among hu-
                     manity. Not as a hidden master, Camarilla style, but as one of them. Just
                     different.

                     Agata: I love it when you talk like that. It makes me feel like a real girl.

                     Rudi: I guess that’s something.

          MILLEN NIU M

           Parasites”, Chinasa Adeyemi interviews the
           Finnish black metal groupie and Brujah

                   of metal bands per capita of any country in the world, clocking in at
                   53,5 bands per 100,000 people. The runners up Norway and Sweden
           only manage 27,2 each. The metal and especially black metal scene seems like an
           obvious choice for a lick who wants to dabble in blood and blasphemy without
           attracting suspicion. Or at least, without attracting more suspicion than your             BY: CHINASA ADEYEMI
           average church-burning Satanist.
               Karoliina Koski is a young vampire who’s spent years as a black metal
           groupie, following bands all around the country.


           Satan's Politics
               I have to ask the most obvious question first. Have you ever felt the urge to create
           your own music?
               I did actually, when I was still human. This was in the late Nineties. I had a
           band, or maybe it was more of a one-person music project, called Lilith’s Satanic
           Flood. It was actually pretty tough going because the scene is so misogynistic. I
           remember one time I stabbed myself into the arm during a gig, and later I was
           accused of faking it. I didn’t fake it! I had ten stitches after that.
               This was before you became one of us?
               Yes, definitely. I was much more hardcore when I was human. You know,
           spitting blood into the audience only makes sense if you’re still breathing. If
           you’re a vampire, you’re going to swallow.

                     Roof of the World
                                       In the second article of her series “Subculture
                                       Parasites”, Chinasa Adeyemi interviews the
                                       former mountain climber and Gangrel Antoni
                                       Morawski.




                                       O
                                                   n the face of it, the subculture of high altitude mountain climbers
                                                   doesn’t seem ideal for our kind. The mountain climbers travel a lot and
                                                   much of the mountain climbing itself happens during the day. Expedi-
                                       tions often attract publicity, making it difficult to maintain the Masquerade.
                                           Yet despite these problems, Antoni Morawski saw no reason to abandon his
                                       lifestyle just because he became a lick.


                                       High Altitude Embrace
                                           You achieved quite a lot even before you became one of us, right?
                                           Perhaps. I did climb many of the famous ones from K2 onwards. The only
                                       one I never managed was Everest. I tried twice, but the weather conditions were
                                       against me. I’m actually most proud of how much money we were able to raise for
                                       charity on our expedition to the Transantarctic Mountains. There’s some excel-
                                       lent climbing there. It’s a shame it’s so hard to get to.

                                       later.
                                           [laughs] That’s true! It was just a few months before I was Embraced.
                                           How did it happen, your Embrace?

                                       dition. I was experimenting with my camera, trying to take photos in low light
                                       conditions when a monster attacked me, mauled me and dragged me to a chasm
                                       in the mountainside. I was sure I would die.

           The Night Circus
                       The Tout
                       Come one! Come all! For tonight only, the Night Circus is in town. Gets your tick-
                       ets, bring your family and see miracles like you’ve never seen before!

                           Watch the Tigers and the Bears, the Elephants and the Seals cavort for your

                           Laugh at our uproariously hilarious clowns as they beat each other with sticks!
                           Learn our story: Founded in Victorian England, the Night Circus is closing in on
                       two centuries of touring all across the world, going from town to town to delight
                       the young and old alike. Taking its aesthetic from the burlesque shows of old, anach-
                       ronistic wunderkammers and the most suicidal circus performances, it’s the most
                       deranged show on Earth.
                           Inside, you will see the centuries melt away as ancient monsters prowl the land
                       once again. The limits of the human form are exposed as the merest fantasy as our
                       acrobats perform the impossible. Feel the madness of the crowd as you participate
                       in a show of cruelty and comedy, terror and wonder so amazing it’ll change your
                       life.
                           Step right up and come right in. It’s the most incredible show on Earth, and
                       you’ll find you’ll never want to leave its shimmering wonderland.


                       The Tent
                       They’ll tell you that you have to live a lie, wear a mask, make your entire existence
                       into a tedious Masquerade. You’ll lie to your family and your friends. You’ll lie to
                       your neighbors and random people on the street. You’ll lie and lie and lie because
                       the truth will kill you.
                           Or so they say.
                           Every night, I look myself in the mirror. With powder and eyeliner, I build my
                       true face. They introduce me to a crowd of hundreds of mortals and they all mur-
                       mur my name.
                           I arrive on horseback, circling the ring, smiling at all the little boys and girls
                       who will fall in love with me forevermore. I drink in their wonder, their adulation,
                       the terror in their eyes as they see how fragile, how slight I appear on the back of a
                       powerful, muscular animal. They sense the violence, the hunger gifted to the beast
                       by our precious Blood.
                           The lights turn up. A rope descends and I leap, pulled up by my lovely compatri-
                       ots hidden in the rigging. They take me all the way to the ropes and trapezes swing-
                       ing high above the audience.

                         I begin my dance. I swing and turn, leap and                    Later, they will bring someone from the audience

                         For that’s how it ends. I make one final jump,
                     somersault in the air. Spread my arms and close my
                     eyes. There’s nothing for me to grab onto. I plummet
                     to the ground.                                                   The Night Circus never stays in town for more than
                         To me, this moment is more beautiful than                    one night, one show. In its wake, it leaves behind
                     anything in existence. The audience senses death,                terrifying memories, blood drained corpses and mu-
                     damage, bones breaking. They sense my intention.                 nicipal authorities confused about who exactly gave

               She’s been in the Camarilla long enough to look offended,
           even when she knows I’m right. “You don’t know...” she starts,
           but I interrupt her.
               “I do know. I’ve studied our history. I know everything
           there is to know about the First Anarch Revolt, the Conven-
           tion of Thorns, the Ventrue and the Toreador. But tonight
           there’s a whole new world that goes beyond all that. Don’t
           get trapped in those stories, because they’ll blind you from
           what’s happening in the world.”
               “So where should we go?” she asks apprehensively, looking
           at the sick and dying mortals around us.
               “You should go”, I say as gently as I can. “I’m not your life.
           We had fun, but we’re not going to be forever. I was your first
           Anarch lover, that’s all.”


           The Fourth Meeting: Marrakech
           I’d decided not to follow her into Marrakech, but I couldn’t
           help it. We meet in an outdoors cafe, a hipster place she sug-
           gested. I say hello to all her friends, and a few of them are our
           kind. She’s integrating quickly.
               “Let’s go outside”, she suggests, taking me to the street,
           away from her new mortal circle. “I’m pretending to work in
           an embassy”, she says self-consciously.
               I feel like a fool, a stupid girl who doesn’t understand that
           this love story is over. I ended it, and now I regret it.
               “Do you remember that night when we first met?” she
           asks. “You took me to the bathroom and told me to drink
           your blood. You pretended it was a test to see if I was for real.
           But you did it because you wanted to get one over a pretty
           girl.”
               “I remember.” I’m not sure I’m ready to talk about all that
           yet. “How’s life in the Ashirra?”
               “It’s good”, she says. “Your contacts helped me out a lot.”
               I knew she couldn’t remain in Europe. There was no place
           she could go to hide from a Camarilla elder. And she wasn’t
           used to the Anarch lifestyle, the care and rigor it took to live
           as one of us in one of the most repressive Camarilla cities in
           the world. But the Ashirra was different. They had the power
           to keep the Camarilla from getting too uppity in their cities.
           And you’d be a fool to assume that a North African Anarch
           like myself didn’t have some Ashirra connections.
               “Do you have a new patron?” I ask her. Lover, is what I
           mean.
               “No”, she says vehemently. “None of that. The first time
           was enough. I won’t be controlled again.”
               “You became an Anarch after all.” ■

           The O
                                        “T
                                                       hat’s not the kind of thing you want to see on the wall of
                                                       your haven”, Louis said, touching the graffiti with his hand.
                                                       The paint still looked fresh on the tile surface of the wall.
                                        “Or anywhere in Milwaukee.”
                                            “Cute house”, Agata Starek replied, looking around the tree-lined
                                        residential street. Each cutesy home was different from the next one,
                                        giving the area a feeling of history. A girl, perhaps ten years old, cycled
                                        down the street and Agata waved at her. “Living in the Camarilla agrees
                                        with you.”
                                            “Fuck you Agata”, Louis snarled, jabbing the Polish woman in the
                                        chest. “This is your fault. This big O right here.”
                                            The graffiti was simple, a large white circle. Fast to paint, it’s signifi-
                                        cance apparent only to the Damned. The mortal neighbors Louis lived
                                        with would just assume his house was defaced.
                                            “Don’t blame me”, Agata laughed. She didn’t fit in the way Louis did.
                                        Louis was a slightly built, well-dressed black man, someone you’d assume
                                        to work as a graphic designer or journalist. He looked friendly, slightly
                                        geeky, as if he was easily embarrassed. Nothing in his appearance sug-
                                        gested he was an Anarch vampire on the run from troubles on the other
                                        side of the Atlantic Ocean.
                                            The main problem with Agata was that she looked just too happy. She
                                        seemed to derive some sort of mysterious enjoyment, seditious joy from
                                        her violent unlife.
                                            “One of the founders of Oswobodziciele was your servant in Kra-
                                        kow. He said you used to starve him, used him for target practice and
                                        murdered his children”, Louis almost shouted the last words before
                                        remembering where he was. In the front of his suburban Milwaukee
                                        haven, hanging around with a known Anarch terrorist in Camarilla ter-

                                        assholes, and they followed me even here. This is your responsibility, and
                                        you need to help me.”

           Red Question?                                                                BY: CHINASA ADEYEMI
           Former Red Question members were
           hounded in the Camarilla and
           ostracized by the Anarchs, but in
           2008 they used the financial crisis to
           strike against Camarilla power.




                       F
                                   or a few short years, the group Red Question dominated discussions
                                   around the Anarch Movement. The Red Question was always some-
                                   thing of a mystery, preferring to operate online and to keep their
                                   membership secret. They talked big, promising a new age of Anarch
                       politics. For a singular moment in history, it looked like they could pull it off.
                           The Red Question ridiculed the Camarilla, its members and institutions
                       with impunity. It featured Tremere apostates in its ranks, despite the tradition-
                       ally aggressive view the Pyramid takes of anybody who wants to leave the Clan.
                       It attacked the established Anarch power structure, depicting Movement ce-
                       lebrities such as Salvador Garcia, Jeremy McNeil and Smiling Jack as outdated
                       hasbeens.
                           The Red Question seemed like it was able to attack anyone, protected by
                       anonymity and technology.
                           When the Red Question claimed responsibility for the 2008 financial crisis,
                       many believed them. They’d already thumbed their noses at so many Princes,
                       why not derail the entire global economy? Now, ten years after the Red Ques-
                       tion’s glory days, it’s easy to dismiss their claims as nothing but bluster. Tonight,
                       the Red Question is remembered as a blip from a more innocent era of Internet
                       politics, when we still believed that social liberation could come from Silicon
                       Valley, for human and Kindred alike.
                           Still, it’s a mistake to write off the Red Question and its achievements. They
                       were supremely gifted at pissing people off, but they sustained the most sig-
                       nificant victory against the Camarilla of the current Millennium, at least until
                       Theo Bell liberated the Brujah from the Ivory Tower.

                                                             broken things. It certainly felt like that when I was dealing with the demands
                                                        of my family, difficulties at the University, shitty boyfriends... I had a tumblr and I
                                                        vented about all the things I couldn’t say out aloud during the day.
                                                            She told me that she wanted to make people into Lilith’s disciples while still

                                                            I had a crush on her, of sorts. I wanted to be her and when she gave me the
                                                        choice to join the Bahari, I accepted even if I didn’t quite understand what she
                                                        meant.
                                                            She took everything from me. She crushed my life, destroyed my family. In

                                                        understand what was happening. I knew she was doing this to me, yet I still ran to
                                                        her, and when I saw her, I saw the Dark Mother. I was on my knees in front of her
                                                        and saw the wonder and the beauty, the terror and the awe. That was the last thing
                                                        I saw as a mortal human, even as she drained my blood away from me.

                                                        and worse. I drank it all, hungrily, confused, scared, alive. Incredibly alive. She
                                                        gave me the words to the Oath to Lilith and I sang them, mumbled, spoke.

           Theo Bell /
           Fuck Theo Bell
           A CONVERSATION BETWEEN SALVADOR GARCIA ,
           THE AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL ANARCH MANIFESTO,
           AND AGATA STAREK, THE KILLER OF KR AKÓW.


                                        Agata: I’ve heard you talk shit about Theo Bell. Why, Salvador? Why
                                        would you do that? He’s the best!

                                        Salvador: He’s not the best.

                                        Agata: Sure he is! I love him! His background is so compelling. Born
                                        a slave in the American South, working the cotton fields under a brutal
                                        overseer. Dreaming of vengeance for the separation of his family, the
                                        abuse suffered by his mother. Amazing stuff!

                                        Salvador: I know the story. He escapes to the North, gets involved
                                        with the Underground Railroad, rescues slaves. I like it how they always
                                        say he rescued those he “deemed worth saving”.

                                        Agata: Exactly! It’s a perfect background for an Anarch. He dedicated
                                        his life to helping others.

                                        Salvador: Judging others.

                                        Agata: He rose from nothing!

                    What Is
               To Be Done?
                                                A conversation between
                                                Agata "failed flower girl" Starek and the
                                                Anarch ideologue Salvador Garcia.


                                                Agata: I know I’m not much of a Movement person, but there’s
                                                a lot of Anarchs out there who could use some tips on tactics.
                                                Like, what to do, what works.

                                                Salvador: You’re asking me for guidance?

                                                Agata: Not for myself. Killing pretty Camarilla boys has always
                                                been my method of choice.

                                                Salvador: Well, my advice for the Movement as a whole would
                                                be this. Abandon violence and violent rhetoric. Instead, try to
                                                change the Camarilla from within by reasoned discourse. If
                                                enough of us show that we’re dependable, trustworthy and able to
                                                compromise, the Princes of the Camarilla will come around and
                                                voluntarily grant us at least some of the freedom we seek.

                                                Agata: What? Seriously?

                                                Salvador: [laughter] I will treasure this moment. The first time
                                                I got the drop on you.

                                                Agata: So we’re not going to start compromising?

                                                            The Fate of Humanity
                                                            Humanity stands disorganized. Weak. Conflicted. Driven by gutless

                                                               Every one of our kind knows this. You have hunted for the blood

                                                               This is a simple truth: When a mortal feeds on too much processed

           I’ve decided to stop being a coward. I’ll go to see the Sheriff, I’ll tell them
           what I think of the city that forced me to kill my sire, and I’ll die.
               Living forever was bullshit anyway. I never made it far enough to be
           a real Anarch, but tonight I’ll do something that would make Salvador
           Garcia proud.


           19th of February, 2018
           Still alive. More than alive. I went to the Sheriff full of righteous fury,
           but they didn’t ask me anything. Instead, they talked about how happy
           they were to see me settle into unlife in Paris and commended me on
           how I’d kept my mortal connections in the academia intact. They told
           me they needed someone to look after the Renfields who managed many
           of their financial assets.
               I could have told them that my background was in macroeconom-
           ics and investment wasn’t really my forte. Instead, I said yes and thank
           you and emerged in control of roughly half a billion euros of Camarilla
           properties.

                 o what do you do when the Camarilla and its elders are too

           S     tough to beat physically and too well connected to beat politically?
                 How do you fight against overwhelming odds?
              Comedy.
              Humor.
              Laughs.
              That’s how.
              Follow in the footsteps of the Merry Pranksters of old and travel from
           Camarilla city to Camarilla city, freaking the squares and showing that the
           Prince is just an ordinary fool, the same as the rest of us!
              Only remember to do it quick and clever, because sometimes the
           punishment for playing the jester is death. Never forget that the enemy is
           always more cruel and petty than you could imagine.

           Here’s a couple classics to get you started:

           1. Exploit the Masquerade. Many elders and Princes appear in public
           settings such as theatre premieres, gallery openings, political fund-
           raisers and charity balls. The presence of mortals prevents them from
           reacting too strongly, even if you did the old activist classic of a custard
           pie in the face.

           2. Use mortal proxies. The great thing about mortals is that they don’t
           know vampires exist. This means you can hire, force or hustle them into
           doing things that are strictly speaking against their self-interest. The elder
           can’t use her powers to reveal the true nature of your ruse if the mortal is
           unaware of it as well. Just remember not to use any mortals you’re attached
           to. Dominating one to heckle an elder in public is fun, but may result in
           death.

           3. Old vampires don’t understand the modern world. You can use this to
           make fun of them. Remember that old episode of the IT Crowd where
           they pretend the Internet is in a box? I bet you could pull that off against
           most Camarilla Princes. Best part about this is that none of the other
           elders will get the joke either.
              Here’s a fun variation, only for those who can get close to an elder:
           Convince them that to maintain the Masquerade, they need to adapt to




                                                                   127

                                                     death. The Prince made him the Court Jester. You’re angry, and
                                            it’s your turn to speak. You call for action. You demand change.

                                            revolutionary cell.
                                                 There’s something missing from our revolution. There’s something
                                            missing from our meetings, our manifestoes, our insurrectionary actions.
                                            There’s something missing even when we fight the enemy in the streets.
                                                 What’s missing is Blood. The feeling of biting deep into the throat of
                                            a soft Patrician and drawing the Blood into your mouth. Tasting it. Feel-
                                            ing the flavor. And then sucking some more, until there’s nothing left.
                                            Not even the poor bastard’s wisp of a soul.
                                                 We need to bring joy back into the revolution. And Blood is joy.


                                            A Tale of Happiness
                                                Let me tell you a story about a single night in the vampire revolution.
                                            As you know, I’m a hometown girl. I was born in Kraków, I became an
                                            Anarch in Kraków and even when I’m not there, my heart will always
                                            remain in Kraków. In my town, we have this thing called “self-respect”. I
                                            know it’s an alien concept to a lot of those living in Camarilla cities, but
                                            you can have it too if you kick the Big C to the curb.
                                                Anyway. Every once in a while, the Camarilla makes a play for our
                                            city. They’ve learned they can’t kill us, so instead they try something
                                            more insidious. They send in someone who’s well connected in mortal
                                            politics, who knows who to bribe and who to blackmail. The plan is to
                                            strengthen the police force, root out our mortal power base and even-
                                            tually raid our Havens. If the plan works, we die in the hands of riot
                                            cops and not a single Camarilla vampire needs to dirty his delicate little
                                            hands.
                                                This time, they sent a pretty Ventrue boy in a sleek suit and perfect
                                            teeth. The perfect object for hatefuck fantasies, for those so inclined.

           CLAN
                                                        Damsel,
                                                        I hear on the grapevine you’re at work teaching new blood about how we do
                                                        with the kine. I asked around some Rabble I’m tight with their thoughts, so
                                                        you could get a mix of perspectives not so clouded with L.A. coke blood. So
                                                        here it is:
                                                              We’re at our most comfortable hiding within humanity, manipulating it
                                                        from the center. Though there are still a few Hellene Princes and Primogen,
                                                        and more commonly, Anarch Barons, our greatest sphere of interest is mortal.
                                                        We know all leeches require living people to remain stimulated, and important-
                                                        ly, well-fed. All the political games Kindred play are nothing if a vampire can
                                                        barely express herself or recall what it was to be warm. We despise stiff rule,
                                                        cold ritual, and a societal status quo. We always fight for change, even if that
                                                        change comes with suffering. And this is perhaps our deepest link to the living -
                                                        we need them, to lead them and be led by their ideas, to help them grasp their
                                                        visions of the future and bring about lasting change.
                                                              It seems despite our worship of the human outsider, we feed mostly from
                                                        the same stock. I guess it’s like we’re shepherds who can’t help but take a bite
                                                        from our prize lambs once in a while. Don’t get me wrong: I love to groom a
                                                        fat cat Wall Street motherfucker and take that kitty down, but that’s less from
                                                        hunger than it is malice and good revolutionary practice. Anyway, he’s prob-
                                                        ably a Blue Blood slave, so it’s a message to his master. Point is, we enjoy the
                                                        fiery blood of the rebel and the downtrodden, because that’s us. We are what
                                                        we eat. It’s also easier to eat among your own.

                   Our desire to exist outside the mainstream
           immerses us in what the kine call counterculture.
           To the outsider, we fall into two camps: those who

                                                                         The Brujah in

              Thanks for the photos big boy.
              They really really made me wet as fuck.



                                         Ain’t no problem doll.
               I’m all man. I’m a pure-blooded Aryan male, just
                                                 like you said.
                                            Just like you like.



              Yeah, you know it. Next time I want you here
              in person. I want you to wrap those thick arms
              around me, lift me up and take me.
              Fascist prick.



                   Sure thing. Tomorrow night? Do you have any
                                   kinks I need to know about?
                         Did you just call me a fascist prick?



              Course not. Autocorrect. lol
              Tomorrow night sounds cool.
              And yeah, I got one.
              Do you mind biting? I like to clamp my teeth
              on to a strapping guy like you.



              As long as you don’t bite my little panzerfaust.

                                                        Caitiff in Vampire Society


               CAiTIFf                                  Even when they are idolized as “the ultimate unbound” by Anarchs, clanless vam-
                                                        pires endure a pretty harsh existence. Even if the unbound trend is towards “you
                                                        are not your clan”, vampires of the same Blood do share an affinity for each other,
                                                        forming bonds of lineage and mutual experience, while the clanless share no such
                                                        commonality. Toreador will gravitate to other Toreador, just as do the Gangrel
                                                        with their own number. This kinship may not be one of friendship, so much as
                                                        familiarity or Blood-borne impulse.
                                                            The Caitiff do not benefit from this association. It is rare for more than one
                                                        Caitiff in a domain to display the same Disciplines, share the same sire, or emerge
                                                        from the same mortal social status or profession. Their connection with each other
                                                        is purely that of being outsiders. Such a bond is tight, for as long as the Caitiff
                                                        tolerate each other.
                                                            In rare cases, Caitiff become Princes and Barons, but clan elitism, overt or
                                                        hidden, makes other Kindred to mock Caitiff attempts at power. Derision compels
                                                        some Caitiff to lofty heights, but breaks others down, turning them into bitter
                                                        creatures sworn to vengeance.
                                                            All Thinblood are Caitiff, their weak 14-16th generation blood so diluted that
                                                        the Blood doesn’t carry the traits of their forefathers. But not all Caitiff are Dusk-
                                                        born. The clanless have always existed, their Blood made mute by estrangement
                                                        from sire and clan, from bitterness and abandonment, Embracing weak human

                                                        much more. The truth is that no-one knows why some Damned are born clanless,
                                                        but everyone has a theory. In some cities like Stockholm, the link between Caitiff
                                                        and thin-bloods has resulted in a new burgeoning sect, one that challenges the
                                                        traditions of even the radical Anarchs. These licks have co-opted the name “The
                                                        Unbound” and celebrate being free from the curses and peculiar impulses of the
                                                        clans. They see themselves as the next step in vampire evolution: better, more pure
                                                        and the only breed able to survive the global Second Inquisition.
                                                            The Church of Caine view Caitiff and thin-blooded both as a portents of the
                                                        end times and directly anathematic to their worship of the Antediluvians. In the
                                                        doctrine of the Church, any vampire not of the 13 established clans are sinful in the
                                                        First’s eyes. This adversity brings many Caitiff and Duskborn together against the
                                                        Church of Caine. Few Caitiff hold membership in the Camarilla, the exclusive sect
                                                        spurning the clanless as scum lacking in the tutelage and tradition necessary to be
                                                        a member, especially in an age of Inquisition. ■

                           Without a sire, you’re not going to have much of a clue
                        about who to feed from and where to do it. Just because
                        you’re a freedom-loving Anarch (aren’t we all?) doesn’t mean
                        you can just sink your fangs into any old mortal and start
                        sucking.
                           Excuse the vulgarity, my friend. I’ll get to the point.
                           We benefit more from the boons of blood exoticism than any
                        other group. You’ll have heard of the Circulatory System by
                        now, and the principle that some blood tastes different and
                        some of it even conveys an edge or two to the drinker. As
                        clanless vampires, we drink from anyone, and require those
                        edges more than any other licks. We are enthusiastic hunters,
                        always on the lookout for an advantage over our competition.
                           You’re going to want to build a herd of nameless faces.
                        Think of an office full of cubicles, a packaging factory, or
                        the regulars at a nightclub. Those people are just the cover
                        we use to get to the best flavors in the background.
                           We are underestimated. Kindred think we’re tasteless bores
                        with no clan stripe and therefore no preference. Do not be
                        mistaken, my friend: we need that edge and so we take it.
                        We catalogue the blood we need and make detailed records of
                        where to find it.
                           Keep all this in mind. Feed from the herd when you have
                        to, under the cover of their peers. When everyone lets their
                        guard down, whether it’s a Prince, a Baron, the Inquisition,
                        or just the kine, you go hunting your true target one-on-one.
                        Make a meal for yourself and enjoy every drop.
                           One last thing: don’t take this email as a good example
                        of how to communicate. This will have triggered any number
                        of flags with them upstairs, which is why I’m behind around
                        a dozen proxies. See this as a test and start running, new
                        fish. If you can survive the upcoming investigation into your
                        whereabouts, you’re worthy of being clanless like me.

                     The Sins of the Caitiff
                     The Caitiff are prone to the arrogance exhibited by outsiders. Though their ostracism
                     is not by their design, their resent for the mainstream forces them to take pride in any
                     behavior that opposes vampires of other clans, or Kindred of the Camarilla.
                         Caitiff are prone to self-deception and the unknowing manipulation of humans.
                     They claim to be better than other vampires due to their fringe natures, but weave webs
                     of intrigue throughout mortal societies, form massive herds, and pursue elaborate hunts
                     for victims of their choice. Though their abuse of mortals is not as systemic as within
                     clans following a rigid hierarchy, the Caitiff tendency to mistreat mortal groups and
                     shrug it off as “them’s the breaks” reveals their callousness toward life. ■

                                 The Duskborn in Vampire Society

        DUSKBORN                 W
                                              e thin-blooded should not be. At least that’s what we’ve been told.
                                              Those who trace their line back to a clan founder can often count their
                                              ancestors on two hands. We need at least three to find our way back to
                                 the source. Not that most of us know about the ancient ones. If we did, we would
                                 run screaming into the nearest furnace. Our modern minds have no place for
                                 ancient blood-gods, magical thinking and eschatological bullshit. Hell, a lot of us
                                 don’t even see ourselves as vampires at all.
                                     My sources say the “Embrace” should not work beyond the 13th generation.
                                 But it does. To the monsters that made us we are a seriously bad omen, or at least
                                 worrying evidence that their precious beliefs about the origins of the Damned
                                 should be questioned. Few ancients enjoy second-guessing the laws and truths
                                 they’ve lived by for millennia. We have become a symbol for a strange present and
                                 a threatening future they can’t understand or be a part of. For more than twenty
                                 years the Camarilla have hunted us like animals, branding us, enslaving us, feeding
                                 from us, using the new blood as pawns in their secret wars. Now that the unbound
                                 have left the Tower for good, many Movement leaders have declared that Dusk-
                                 born have nothing to fear in Anarch domains, or even that we will be sheltered
                                 from Camarilla persecution in unbound cities. Color me suspicious, but it’s a start.
                                     Duskborn draw loathing from older licks and sympathy from the young.
                                 Duskborn embraces are rarely intentional, and our existence is unwelcome in most
                                 domains. Yet we are here to stay, more numerous than ever, often entirely separate
                                 from the rest of vampire society. The superstitious do not trust we even exist and
                                 the political do not know how to classify us. No other licks show such ability for
                                 enduring the sun, holding food in their dead stomachs, or can develop new powers
                                 straight from the mix of resonant blood they consume. We are not quite dead, and
                                 this scares the thickbloods shitless. No lick can masquerade as human the same
                                 way a Duskborn can. We are uniquely suited to survive this age of inquisition and
                                 we have no stakes in the eternal struggle between the Damned. Our unlife-stories
                                 are personal, gritty, and more often than not, short and bloody.
                                     Most of us Duskborn want nothing to do with the monsters that infected us,
                                 and we don’t identify as anything but a person with a strange affliction. We are an
                                 opportunity and a threat. The Camarilla do not recognise the Duskborn as Kin-
                                 dred and uphold the masquerade as diligently towards Mercurials as they do to-
                                 wards the living. This means Duskborn in Camarilla domains often know next to
                                 nothing about what we are, or about the culture of the damned in general. We’re
                                 happy to keep it that way, finding our own nichés of the night-city to inhabit,
                                 taking a sip here and a sip there while we pretend we are still human, or desper-
                                 ately search for a way to cure this weird condition. A few of us learn the truth and
                                 aspire to full membership in the Camarilla or the Anarch Movement, the way I
                                 did, and go out of their way to prove themselves to the very monsters that made us
                                 and discarded us.
                                     The threat of persecution constantly hanging over us causes many Duskborn to
                                 choose the lives of nomads, passing from domain to domain in RVs or freight-ships
                                 turned into mobile Havens. Our relatively human physiology makes travel far less

                                            We rub shoulders with our still-living
                                            friends and family, without feeling like
                                            we’re butchers chatting to the cattle.
                                            Their lives are important to us, because
                                            we’re still like them! We can still ex-
                                            perience something of mortality that the
                                            monsters just fundamentally lack.

                                            When the nightborn ask us how we blend
                                            in with the kine, I tell them this: “it’s
                                            easier to see the living with clar-

                                            Prince’s asshole.” I used to say “your
                                            own asshole,” but since we were for-
                                            mally accepted as an Anarch ally, I now
                                            tend to direct that kind of thing at the
                                            Tower. But the point is the same. If you
                                            stop seeing yourself as a person, as a
                                            human being, you can’t blend in. You fake
                                            it. We are for real.

                                            We mix with the living without dif-
                                            ficulty and thumb noses at those who
                                            struggle. I mean, how hard is it to
                                            remember how to act with lovers and
                                            friends? You’d think that even though
                                            you’re a bloodsucking dickhead, you’d
                                            still know how to dance without look-

                                            nachos, snort lines, and deepthroat a guy
                                            in the toilets just for the hell of it.
                                            But no, for most licks that’s all “going
                                            too far.” I think they’re all afraid of
                                            being human and settle for pretending.
                                            No wonder they become monsters.

                                                            The key to this kind of story is making existence as a vampire seem sexy,
                                                            vibrant, cool and desirable at first. Then reality hits. A loved one is killed
                                                            by the player characters, the characters come face-to-face with the hor-

                                                            to do thinks they considered unthinkable in life. Use the Convictions
                                                            and Touchstones of the player characters to get them to this moment of
                                                            crisis, and then introduce the possibility of redemption. If you don’t mind

                                                            But after introducing redemption as an option, can it actually be achieved?
                                                            We recommend that there is no single way to return to the living. Instead,
                                                            the path back into the light is directly linked to the individual character
                                                            and what makes for a great emotional story. A feature could be that
                                                            redemption requires the Duskborn to kill their own sire, a quest that is
                                                            easy to turn into an exciting multi-part chronicle, especially if the player
                                                            characters decide to help each other hunt the monsters that made them.
                                                            But that is seldom enough. In addition to destroying the sire, regaining
                                                            mortality might also include:

                                                              that consigns the redeemed to the fires of hell when they eventually
                                                              die. Of course, the thin-blood may not believe in damnation at all, but
                                                              they will soon become aware of their mistake.

                               It is with great sadness I find you affiliating with the wretched Anarch Movement. I know

                               daddy is still at home, waiting for you.
                                    I shall be leaving Milwaukee soon, so you will not find me there. Phoenix is my likely
                               destination, but it entirely depends on that fool Esau and where he ends up. Anyhow, there is

                                    We were never meant for the Camarilla.
                                    Maybe you know this already. I shall give a potted history that might act as a euphoric,
                               should your mind be inclined.
                                    When we attended the Convention of Thorns, our clan divided into a roughly 50/50 split.

                               time. It is where the Blood compelled us to go. But no, half the clan resisted, and just as the
                               poles shift, so did the sanity of our clan. Sabbat drove the sane insane and Camarilla acted as
                               nepenthe to the madness. It is true!
                                    So where does that leave you, my precious daughter? You are in the void. You and your
                               sister both. It is tragic for me to say, but not a one Malkavian joined the Anarch Movement
                               upon its formal foundation. Not a one. Why? Because it is not meant for us!
                                    If you consider yourself one of the Unchained, you are disconnecting from the Blood, the
                               Cobweb, the Network, and the poles of which I spoke.
                                    It is a tragedy to me that you, and so many like you, would willingly throw yourselves into
                               a black hole with no hope of emergence. But alas, it is your choice. I will still love you, even as
                               you lose touch with the pull of wisdom one side or t’other.
                                    Fare well, my glorious daughter. Send my regards to your sister. ■

                                                  continuing. “We don’t care too much about sects, but when some Anarch

                                                      The two tangled up, doing away with the rules of boxing to wrestle

                                                  with a question, his voice thin and reedy as it whistled through his

                                                      A spray of blood across the ring signalled the bellringer to do

                                                      Calebros applauded his fighter as he exited the ring to drink from

                                                      He pointed at his two companions with each hand. “Never forget we

            ABSTRACT
                                               “I
                                                             t’s incredibly easy to dismiss the Anarch Toreador as fad-chasing philistines,”
                                                             Victoria whispered to her companion, walking arm in arm with her guest as
                                                             they strode through the Art Hole Gallery, “but there’s something delightfully
                                                             avant-garde about their artistic thrash.” She cocked her head to the instal-
                                               lation taking up a full quarter of the room, a collection of auto parts sprayed with what
                                               was assumedly a burgundy paint.
                                                   “I’m told the creator of this piece refuses to define its meaning, which is right and
                                               proper. It is up to the patron to derive meaning from art.” She gently hefted an engine
                                               block from the floor, examining it carefully, tipping it slightly to hear a slosh of liquid
                                               inside. “What does this mean to you?”
                                                   The crippled Scab in her company groaned as he shuffled closer to the supposed art
                                               on display. “I don’t know, do I? It looks like a car crash smeared in blood. It looks like the
                                               artist found the remains from a collision, put them on a flatbed, and drove them to this
                                               fucking gallery to take the piss out of Artistes like you.” Castillo eyed the car fragments
                                               without much interest, before his scabbed over eyes widened in realization. “You do know
                                               whose car this was, right?”
                                                   Victoria shook her head without speaking, transfixed as she was with the lumps of
                                               metal. She ran a finger over the hardened rivulets of blood that had found their ways into
                                               the dents and cracks in the engine.
                                                   “This is Prince Rowlands’ Merc, you bloody fool.” Castillo waded into the heart of the
                                               exhibit, taking the piece in as if he was an investigator and this was a crime scene. “They
                                               found his charred body, torpid, in that fucking shop window, but someone had nicked
                                               the car. This is his! It’s been dismantled, but it’s his! I recognize the bloody keyring hang-
                                               ing off the car key, still in the bastard ignition!” The Archon pulled the key out, jangling
                                               it at Victoria Ash.
                                                   For her part, Victoria just smiled. “Then maybe we do our Anarch cousins a disservice.
                                               Perhaps the message they want their art to convey is clear, after all.” ■

                     Report #414 – Toreador
                     Anarchists
                     Following our interviews with Subject
                     #91 and #93, it becomes apparent that
                     while the post-mortals identifying as
                     “Toreador” experience a schism within
                     their family, this fracture in philoso-
                     phy does not lead to violence. This is
                     an unfortunate revelation, as we were
                     seeking a way of disuniting this group,
                     who otherwise seem ill-disposed to
                     conflict. We do not believe they abhor
                     internal fighting as much as view it
                                                                     “I’d expected                 into the Anarch Move-

           your ghouls. I know you
           fuckers don’t care much
           for them anyway.”
               Masha rolled her
           eyes. “You think we just
           use and abuse the kine?
           Stop buying all the
           Anarch propaganda you
           write, for God’s sake.”
           She clicked her fingers
           and a sharp-suited
           Kindred was at her side
           carrying two briefcases.
           “This is all the money
           you asked for, in all
           the denominations you
           asked for.”
               Rosa allowed one of
           her friends to take the
           cases, leaving the two
           alone for a minute. “I’m
           guessing you’ve still not
           told the Prince where
           you get this supply?”
           She already knew the
           answer, but wanted to
           hear it from her sister.
               “No… She doesn’t
           think well of Anarchs.
           But hey, you don’t think
           well of her, so no big
           deal, right?” Mascha put
           a hand on her sister’s
           upper arm in a stiff, but
           comforting gesture. “It
           really makes no differ-
           ence to me though. You
           could be Sabbat for all
           I care. We’re both of the
           same blood in more ways
           than one. We’re family.”
               Rosa went in for
           another hug with her
           sister. “We are. None of
           this shit will ever drive
           us apart.” ■

                                                   The coterie of Warlocks each smiled to the sound of the commanding voice, broad-
                                               casted from another world for all they cared. The bond was severed. The voice was cor-
                                               rect: the enslavement was finished. They were free to become whatever they wanted to be.
                                               They could forge their own destiny now.
                                                   “Only through perfect balance between activity and inactivity, waking and resting,

                                               center of the world, you-” The voice cut off abruptly, the transmission failed. One of the
                                               Warlocks opened her eyes, one after the other, sneaking a look around the room. She saw
                                               her fellow adherents doing the same.
                                                   “Can you hear that?” Roland, the Neophyte of the group, asked the question without
                                               opening his eyes.
                                                   “Nothing.” Beatrice answered. “Nothing at all. No crackle of static. No air condition.

                                               clothing themselves. This was the moment they’d been warned about, when the House
                                               came back to claim them.

                                Xbor5: No. True. We gotta ride this momentum we got now in the A
                                and act against them or take Vienna for ourselves.

                                DrMagus: No way we’re going back there. No way. You said this was
                                good intel. What are we supposed to do with this? It’ll put us
                                right under the I’s nose.

                                Xbor5: We already there. They watching us now. Not here, but we
                                stick out like a sore thumb. Look, we use that to our advantage.

                                Devlin: This isn’t as stupid as it sounds. Do you know where
                                they’re planting their new tree?

                                Xbor5: I can get you coordinates. But on a different channel. I
                                swear this is truth. They’re too worried about all the unclaimed
                                goodies scattered around the city and want to reclaim it.

                                Devlin: Okay okay I believe you. You text me coordinates, okay?

                                DrMagus: If you want the Ips in on this, you’re going to have to
                                send us down payment, understand? We aren’t doing this for free.

                                Xbor5: Sure. I got a whole bevy of vgins and fresh vtay just for
                                your house. Make it in the style old man Trembly used to like.

                                               here’s no such thing as an Anarch Ventrue.” Upton Rowlands kept his
                                               hands on the wheel, his eyes straight ahead, only his lips moving. He
                                               was tired of this kind of backchat from his childe. “You need to put the
                                               thought from your head. A Blue Blood who abandons the Camarilla is
                           no Blue Blood at all. More of a clanless wretch, if you ask me.” The car came to rest at a
                           red light, puttering as the driver waited for the lights to change.”
                               “So you’re saying we can leave the Camarilla if we choose to?” The voice was from the
                           backseat. Upton’s childe, Tasha, was lounging back there without a seatbelt on and not
                           dressed in the formal get-up her sire had requested the night before. She was a wild one.
                           Upton almost regretted her Embrace, but for her valuable connections in the sports enter-
                           tainment business of Connecticut.
                               “No.” The older Ventrue put his foot down as the lights flicked from red to amber,
                           conscious of the time and when they were due to meet Warwick and his fellow Leper. This
                           was an important meeting and they were not to be late. “If you leave, it is our responsibil-
                           ity to put you down or bring you back. We will do one or the other. Probably the first.
                           You wouldn’t be the only one of our clan to tire of the hierarchy, but I promise you, give it
                           more than a few decades and you’ll understand why we’ve pinned our colors to the Cama-
                           rilla.” Despite his undead nature, Upton sighed. “Ventrue do not exist within the Anarchs
                           because our Blood rebels against such freedom. Our lineage is one of nobility, law, and
                           loyalty. The Anarchs respect none of these things.”
                               “I respect loyalty.” Tasha’s voice trembled a little as she leaned forward, one hand on
                           the door handle to her right. “It’s just I’ve realized who I should be loyal to in these nights.”
                               With her left hand she thrust a blade between the headrest and the seat, piercing her
                           sire’s spine and throat. With her right, she opened the door and tumbled to the road,
                           watching as the car careened into the window of a furniture store, flames swiftly bursting
                           from the vehicle.
                               She couldn’t help but think that went better than expected as she fled Hartford to
                           meet with her new friends in the Anarch Movement. ■

                                 Report #412 – Venture Anarchists
                                 Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to instigate or
                                 discover an existing schism within the post-mortal group known
                                 as the “Venture” (assumedly named after venture capitalists, ac-
                                 cording to Report #115). This is unfortunate, due to the apparent
                                 leadership role these haemovores occupy among their infectious
                                 species. It appears many defer to them no matter their political
                                 or philosophical affiliation, from a meek and post-mortal stand-
                                 point alike.
                                    We have discovered several Venture post-mortals among the An-
                                 archist Movement in commanding positions, typically of the mili-
                                 taristic variety. According to our research, it is uncommon for
                                 these individuals to take on political power within the Anar-
                                 chists, due to a lack of trust regarding their motives. Instead,
                                 they lead assault parties on a localized, paramilitary scale,
                                 harassing post-mortals not of the Anarchist group or attacking
                                 the meek in order to accumulate power.
                                    Of interest are the Venture Anarchists recruited specifically
                                 for the purposes of obliterating memory of haemovore presence in
                                 an area. We have only interviewed two subjects who recall any of
                                 the details surrounding these operations, but it is apparent the
                                 Anarchists utilize these Venture as hypnotists and thugs, intim-
                                 idating or brainwashing victims into forgetting facts surround-
                                 ing haemovore activity. These actions go some way to explaining
                                 the lack of meek knowledge concerning these people. ■

           Free Ventrue? Hardcore Ventrue? True Ventrue?
           There’s no difference. Look, Kindred here don’t
           trust us, but they sure as shit respect us. They
           really shouldn’t. We broke free from the Grade-A
           Camarilla clan. Big whoop. We have the greatest
           number of Princes out there. Why should that make
           a difference to the Anarchs?
              Being here in the Movement is a little like
           being an exiled king. You’ve done very little to
           earn the respect of others, but because of who you
           are, you get it anyway. It’s sick and twisted, and
           it shows just how easy the Ventrue have it. We
           say jump, they ask “how high,” before they realize
           they’re supposed to be Anarchs.
              There aren’t many clans in the Anarchs who can
           twist wills like we do. Find me a King who hasn’t
           mastered the art of getting into the heads of vic-
           tims and commanding them to “forget” or “run.” You
           won’t. You know why? We Ventrue are all alike.
           You can’t cut out the cancer when we are the can-
           cer. This is who we are, and the sooner we stop
           acting like we’re in any way like the freedom-
           loving Kindred in this sect, the sooner we can
           stop this mass delusion. ■

           In vampire domains, the Ministry comfortably                     that the clan has become associated with the serpent
           serves two purposes. On one hand they are suppliers              of the Garden of Eden. Officially, the clan ostensibly
           unafraid to dirty their hands with drugs, vessels, and           considers its Egyptian holdouts as anachronisms tied

           martyrs: They fraternize with sin so others need not.
           In this way, they retain plausible deniability. Most

           strength to make these claims unchallenged. The ire

            starve them: The Organization starts moving
            against their Turf or poaching on their hunting
            grounds. With a mortal Organization, it’s just
            adding protection: cops or capos. With a vampire
            organization, it might involve deniable Caitiffs
            startling all the quail.
            wake them up: The Organization finds and at-
            tacks their haven. This doesn’t have to be a daylight
            SI raid – it can be a highway re-route or a quick sale
            to a condo developer. Again, a Touchstone or other
            relationship map figure might be exposed by this
            attack.


            Setting the Hounds
            The coterie are a real threat now, and what’s worse
            the Organization believes it. The Prince has tasked
            the Primogen to deal with it, Washington wants
            action, shit is about to get real.
            interview: The loyal coterie must square off with
            their biggest rival: compete to complete a crucial
            mission, with all the backstabbing that involves.
            Or perhaps just a throwdown for all the marbles in
            Elysium or a council meeting.
            hunting cry: The Prince hasn’t called a Blood
            Hunt because it’s undignified and against the code
            and might be dangerous in itself if the coterie has
            been at all careful to cultivate other factions in
            the domain. But someone is after the coterie now,
            someone more powerful than they are, who has the
            Prince’s nod. The Second Inquisition just orders
            them killed and deploys a hunter team to do it.


            A Land of Wolves Now
            The coterie has to come to some agreement with
            their foe, or they have to destroy them. There is no
            other alternative. Of course, some other Organiza-
            tion may have noticed all the ruckus and put both
            the coterie and their enemies on a watch list –
            there’s always a bigger flea to bite ‘em. ■

                    alvador Garcia is not famous as a killer of Camarilla Kindred or
                    a reckless Masquerade breaker, yet many Princes fear his coming
                    to their city more than any violent troublemaker. Garcia fights
                    the war of ideas, traveling from city to city rousing up the local
            Anarch underclass to fight for their rights.
                Garcia's role is like that of a union agitator: He talks to young licks,
            helps them see that they don't have to accept their miserable role in
            undead society and carries news from other domains. One single visit
            can leave ideas germinating in the mind of a city's disenfranchised,
            leading to the birth of a new Anarch Movement.
                Originally famous as the chief ideologue of the Anarch Free States
            in California and the killer of the old Prince of Los Angeles, Garcia
            now visits his home city only rarely. Instead, he uses his extensive con-
            tacts in the Movement to travel from domain to domain, spreading the
            revolution and evading Camarilla forces keen to see the "undead Che
            Guevara" executed.


                                                                           Lore

                     or a Ventrue ancilla, the name Agata Starek summons images of nihilistic,
                     gleeful terror, Anarchs as a wave of destruction demolishing everything in its
                     path. But for the neonate anarchs living under the arbitrary and cruel rules
                     imposed by that same Ventrue, she's the very personification of revolution as
            revenge. Who cares if we're going to live another night? Let's tear these bastards down
            right now.
                More ideological and principled Anarch leaders tend to despise Starek because
            of her practice of diablerie and lack of interest in any utopian cause. For them,
            she's nothing but a monster, little better than the creatures of the Camarilla. Yet
            their perspective might be tainted by the power they wield, because Starek does
            have one single principle: She always punches up, usually literally. She's famous
            for turning on her friends and allies in favor of a mistreated ghoul or suffering
            human.
                For all their dislike of Starek, few Anarch leaders really want to make a move
            against her. Deep in their unbeating hearts, they too appreciate the idea of a mon-
            ster of their own, a joyous terror giving the Camarilla something to be afraid of.
                The less power you have, the more hope Agata Starek gives you.
                                                                           Lore

                         in these turbulent nights, Hesha Ruhadze stands like an old
                         rock in a stream. When asked about sectarian allegiances, the
                         Nubian archaeologist rolls his eyes and mutters to himself. He
            spurns politics, referring to it as a wasted focus for creatures that might
            live for an eternity. His dedication is to history, the mysteries of vampire
            origins, and importantly, discerning their fates. All the while, he sits in at
            Anarch moots and listens attentively.
                Hesha is a willing servant of the Blood, and believes he can under-
            stand the voice of Sutekh calling from his vitae. Where this might be a
            mark of insanity for some vampires, Hesha’s standing among Kindred
            far and wide lends credence to his claims. He is still the same coolly
            charming man, and every word he speaks feels heavy with gravitas, but
            now he speaks as the herald of his god’s will. Every time he does so, it is
            with a smile.

                             they still revere Set as their founder and
                             the first vampire, it is less common for
            a Setite of the Ministry to cling only to the worship of
            Sutekh. This is not the case among those Setites who claim
            membership in the very Church of Set. Dedicated to the
            rites of Setite Orthodoxy, the Church of Set’s members
            believe they must conspire to weaken all other clans and
            their founders in order to pave the way for the resurrec-
            tion of their founder. Your membership in the Church of
            Set may be as a new adherent, desperate to find meaning
            and mentorship in a hostile world, or you may be one of
            the dedicated faithful, rejecting the idea of enslavement to
            other Antediluvians and seeking freedom from all chains

                          He spoke of interacting with one of the Antediluvians and
            seeing his entire coterie eaten alive by this mythological creature. He ac-
            cused the Camarilla of perfidy against its members and cast aside his role
            of Gangrel Justicar.
                News travels slowly among the Gangrel, as a clan with little hierar-
            chy and lacking an effective communication network. Slowly, Gangrel
            followed Xaviar out of the Camarilla, some becoming Autarkis, while
            more ultimately joined the Anarchs.
                Gangrel now share a communal guilt for their initial disbelief of
            Xaviar’s claims and slow reaction to his proclamation, as he met Final
            Death soon after. Few know if the Camarilla or some other agency slew
            the mighty Gangrel, but all know their ancestor was wronged. Now

            inspired the Anarch Movement. Tyler herself doubts that

            clanmates compare her to everyone from Robin Hood, to
            Malcolm X, to Che Guevara, to Gavrilo Princip.
               Tyler still exists: a quiet, studious rebel in these
            nights. With centuries of reflection, she struggles to
            reconcile her actions with the results of modern nights.
