             MORTAL DAYS: PRODIGY
                  Florian was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. Both
             of his parents were engineers, and he grew up around
             plans for bridges and architectural measurements. If asked,
             he says he always had a knack for recognizing patterns and
             sequences. He easily fell into games like chess and found
             tasks involving numeracy to be second nature.
                  While other child prodigies were often distant and
             aloof, Florian was always warm and gregarious. At times,
             he made off-color remarks about the beautiful symmetry
             of someone’s face, but those remarks were always in the
             positive. He graduated from the University of São Paulo
             with master’s degrees in both mathematics and quantum

             her face red from a punch delivered by her partner. The

             er begged for him to leave, fearing that if he remained he
             would surely be killed.
                  For Jörg, compulsory civil service in the Bundeswehr,
             the Federal Defence Force, beckoned. As part of his
             deployment within a peacekeeping force, Jörg saw service
             in Afghanistan. He served as an engineer, constructing
             infrastructure, hospitals, and schools for local communi-
             ties and NATO forces.
                  As with many soldiers, Jörg found the duties and
             routines of service an endless tedium punctuated by bouts
             of sheer terror. One night, on patrol, he and his detach-
             ment were simply to confirm the security of an important
             archeological site. As they walked through the ruins, a scout
             radioed in a discovery of several bodies, apparently mauled
             by wild animals. The soldiers cautiously converged on the
             location, only to find themselves led into a trap. Their scout
             was being used as a puppet to beckon a food supply toward
             its master, with the meal being Jörg and his comrades. The
             ancient terror murdered and gutted Jörg’s fellow soldiers. It
             moved fast, like a wind of razor blades. What Jörg glimpses

                  Jenni was the perfect student. She was diligent in her

    CHILDREN OF THE BLOOD




                  Once the war was over, they parted ways, and Raíz
             took a job traveling with a Spanish widow who needed a
             companion for reasons of propriety. As the widow pre-
             ferred to be left to her own devices — and her own social
             class — Raíz had time to continue writing in her cramped
             quarters. She sent things off to magazines and newspa-
             pers under a pseudonym, but with the instruction that if
             published, the money should go to her family back home,
             as her father and brother were both injured in the war.
                  When she did show her writing, now mostly fiction,
             to anyone who asked, there was always a comment made
             about her work being “striking,” “inspired,” or “unusual.”
             She never quite understood what they meant; putting
             words on the page came easily to her, and she did it
             mostly for fun and because it was her primary hobby in
             the postwar world.
             KINDRED NIGHTS: THE LONG WAIT
                  In 1824, after returning home, Joaquin found Raíz
             at night again. In another time, he would have set her
             heart to racing, but he was changed somehow. Different.
             He didn’t exchange pleasantries or ask where she had
             been for the last few years, merely telling her he needed
             her help. She nodded and followed him through familiar
             streets, but the room that once housed his press now              got out. She began going by “Raíz” then, and the only
             contained only a strange white woman. Joaquin mouthed             thing that brought her out of her state of wonder was
             “I’m sorry” at Raíz before bolting, and that was the last         the hearing a woman being beaten by her partner in the

             quicker than Raíz liked. She forgave him, deep down, but          moving from domain to domain, following crime reports

               Epitaph: The Headmistress
               Quote: “One can always do better.”

               Embraced: 1903 (Born 1860)

                   Born Emily Anne Fitzsimmons, Miss Fitzsimmons
             grew up as a rather plain daughter of minor nobility in a
             time when fortunes changed hands based on a woman’s
             ability to wield a fan and get laced into a corset. Though
             she considered joining the church to get away from her
             mother’s laments about her “spinster daughter,” she chose
             teaching as a vocation after her years in boarding school.
                   Once she achieved the rank of headmistress at her
             first post, a small girls’ academy in Wales, she found the old
             axiom about power true. While she started out meaning to
             be fair but firm, the ability to treat not only her students but
             other teachers in any way she wished went to her head. She
             ordered and barked, and employed cold stares and too-fre-
             quent slaps, to get her point across or make her wishes clear.

                   She was intelligent, though, and self-aware, so she left

            bloody tears over his lost mortal family. Eventually,
            though, something snapped. All the pent-up anger he let
            out at his sire bubbled back up, and when he saw a man
            dragging a child into a workhouse against their will, he
            rose to his full height for the first time in decades, scaring
            off the would-be kidnapper.
                  Afterwards, he became a defender of women, chil-
            dren, and the impoverished, letting out his rage on those
            who deserved it, until he fell to torpor sometime in the
            late 19th century. He awoke in a long-abandoned section
            of London’s sewer system about five years ago, to a world
            in chaos he didn’t recognize. A local Mithraic cultist dis-
            covered him and, upon hearing the circumstances of his
            Embrace — the diablerie tactfully omitted, Derek main-
            tains his sire abandoned him and he never knew her name
            — took Derek under his wing, promising to show him
            what vampiric society was like when one had a family.
                  Derek left London as part of the cult’s exodus, and is
            now a third-step adherent of the Mithraic Mysteries. He
            isn’t sure how much he genuinely believes, but he’s an ex-
            cellent brute-strength enforcer, and feels better about the
            killing if he can absolve himself of it in Mithras’ name.

    CHILDREN OF THE BLOOD




                 THE FORMULA
                 You’re in a terrible relationship. You lose your job. You can’t pay your bills. All your friends are abandoning you
                 for someone with fewer problems. You get through a bottle of wine a night to take the edge off. That wine becomes
                 spirits as you find vodka goes further for less money. You thought moving away from your family was a good idea
                 way back when, but you can’t go back to them now. Not while you’re like this. You’re in the gully, but you’ll climb
                 out. Your luck will return some day.
                 But it doesn’t. You’re on the streets. You went from drinking to snorting to injecting. You think with all your credit cards
                 maxed out and loans unpaid, your name’s probably with some cops somewhere for fraud, or non-payment of taxes,
                 or who knows what. You’re alone. The climb is even steeper now and it looks impossible, at least until a person with
                 a warm smile, gentle words, and an extended hand offers you a way out. You never believed in religion before this,
                 but maybe it’s a lifeline, or at least a church-run shelter is a place to rest your head while you get back on your feet.
                 If all you need to do is pass out wafers and sing hymns, it’s a small price to pay.
                 Religion can indeed be salvation to someone at their lowest ebb. In the cases of some cults, it’s a method of con-
                 trol. Sometimes it’s a combination of both, providing order and ritual to a life without meaning, and comfort and
                 understanding to a tormented soul. Many of the characters in this book go through the formula of sinking to their
                 lowest before they’ll ever consider a destiny involving belief, but it’s rarely the belief that draws them: it’s the promise
                 of companionship, the security of an institution that offers aid, and the generosity of those who offer a way out. It
                 should come as no surprise that vampires in cults are commonly those who received unsanctioned Embraces, or
                 were abandoned by their sire, who were betrayed by their sects, or found their lives, appearances, or philosophies
                 rebuked by others.
                 The formula dictates that when anyone — vampire or mortal — is at their most vulnerable, they are infinitely more
                 inclined to lean on religion for support. Cults depend on this vulnerability to fill their ranks, and perversely, they tend
                 to get so far into the heads of their initiates, that those new believers never realize they’ve been played, and will
                 fight tooth and nail against anyone who tells them they were manipulated. There is greater zeal in a convert than
                 someone who joins a religion with eyes wide open.

                 Her wish was granted when she caught the eye of the
            expedition leader from Portugal who had come to trade
            with her father. Their party arrived in the night, which
            was unusual for foreigners travelling the dangerous roads.
            He spoke to her in her own tongue, offering her a chance
            at education and discovery abroad. Grace jumped at the
            chance and accompanied them back to the coast in secret.
            It was soon after their arrival in Portugal she discovered
            her true purpose was to educate the Kindred who had
            abducted her. She was stripped of her will by the dark-
            eyed foreigner and questioned on her people’s defenses,
            capabilities, and the locations of their settlements.
                 On the fifth night of her captivity, she was awakened
            by a commotion. A privateer named Captain Alonso Sala-
            zar had come to free her from her captor. She fell in love
            with her rescuer and his free-spirited nature. He kept her
            close and she learned to communicate in the languages of
            the lands they visited. Salazar offered her a place by his side
            as an officer and she accepted, becoming part of his eternal
            crew as she fell to his fangs and her blood stained the deck.

            large parts of cities in the same terminal decline she had
            witnessed in her childhood home. Qingzhao felt ashamed
            for how she had lived, uncaring and unfeeling, never con-
            sidering what her actions did to others. She had lived well
            while choking the lifeblood of these communities.
                 Qingzhao wept tears of blood and fell to the ground
            before her sire, begging him to let her work to rebuild
            everything she had destroyed. Finally satisfied, the hermit
            released her from his tutelage and disappeared into the
            earth.
                 Qingzhao decided to not re-enter public life, remain-
            ing on the sidelines, protecting those communities she
            neighbored. She broke up bandit camps and discreetly
            helped small traders and farmers with their work. With
            each small kindness, she found her way back to herself,
            and bettering herself and the world around her became
            her goal.
                 She felt, however, that the hermit had shown her
            how to rid herself of one terrible sin at the cost of anoth-
            er. Whatever she did, she found herself entering towns
            and villages to feed. At times, she starved herself to mad-
            ness and awakened in the night with the corpse of one of
            the very people she was trying to help at her feet. She was
            no longer a bandit; she was now a demon.                            •   Haunting Past: The actions of Qingzhao’s past are

             T        he Rossellini and the Giovanni were once rivals
                      in necromancy. The Rossellini had more talent,
                      but the Giovanni had more ambition. That led to
             the latter becoming the Clan of Death for 500 years, and
             the other becoming a minor bloodline. The two families
             share many traits, save for one: ghost manipulation. The
             Giovanni prefer to coax and cajole, with an occasional
             threat. The Rossellini begin with threats, browbeating,
             and dominating wraiths into doing their bidding. The
             Family takes a sadistic glee using Oblivion.

             pitiful remains, doomed to lament about what they once
             had. The least you can do is give purpose to their miser-
             able unlives. One day you’ll die and join their sorrowful

              I    n the 1950s, the Milliner family joined Clan Gio-
                   vanni out of spite. They weren’t known for their
                   prowess with Oblivion, but their connections helped
              the clan survive major shifts in organized crime, and the
              rise of the Second Inquisition. Their only reward was
              more work and tighter restrictions on feeding and the
              Embrace, something the Family Reunion did little to
              rectify. The Milliners have the most responsibilities and

             T        he Ashfinders is a cult for the modern era. Its word
                      is spread over the internet, its holy land is the
                      island of Ibiza, and its sacred ritual is developing
             designer drugs. The brainchild of a renegade Tremere and an
             influential Duskborn, the Ashfinders are a radical new form
             of Golconda cult. They seek transcendence through the cre-
             ation and consumption of Ashe, formulated from the ashes
             of deceased full-blooded vampires. The drug is ineffective
             on mortals and full-blooded vampires, but in thin-blooded,
             it enhances their blood and can even grant them memories
             or abilities from the dead vampires mixed into the concoc-
             tion. The cult hypes themselves with social media posts and
             advertises as a New Age solution to mortals, and an exciting
             journey into enlightenment to Mercurians. What the trend-
             setters don’t talk about is Ashe’s highly addictive nature,
             and the strange creatures the drug’s creation generates.
                  As an initiate of the Ashfinders, you find yourself in a
             thrilling, dangerous time. You’re certain that you’ve found
             a new path out of your condition, even if some of your

             of diablerie. Let those wizened old has-beens believe what

                     eador Antediluvian, was one of the first victims of
                     diablerie. Her grieving lovers took vengeance upon
              the act’s first culprit, and as the practice came into fashion,
              swore to ensure anyone who drained a vampire would face
              Final Death. The Amaranthans survive to this very day
              hunting down diablerists with little mercy. While they
              had long been tolerated in Camarilla domains for their
              swift action against the Sabbat, the sect’s withdrawal has
              led many domains to reject the cult as their focus turns
              towards the Ivory Tower and the Anarch movement.

            refused to take hold in her. In the modern nights, some
            Nosferatu are visited in daysleep dreams by a woman
            who removes their blemishes and guides them to rule

            and stereotypes, dressing in fine clothes and adorning
            themselves in oils and perfumes. The confidence and

             and enlightenment could be found through assimilation
             with humanity. They struggled for a fairer society for the
             Kindred. To the Meneleans, one of the greatest forms of
             tyranny was one that elders held over younger genera-
             tions. When Menele vanished and the cult’s Blood Bonds
             shattered, his cultists were fully aware of the irony.

             their own morals, and how much came from Menele’s

                   encourages vampires to seek Golconda by master-
                   ing the Beast and becoming the ultimate predator.
            Followers gather in meetings and encourage everyone,
            including curious newcomers, to openly discuss the
            lowest, darkest moments in their unlife. This is for two
            reasons: to advise the Kindred on how to overcome their
            inhuman natures, and to gather secrets the cult can use to
            gain followers and power. The One True Way is banned in
            many domains across the world, but this has only seemed
            to increase its popularity.
                  As a traveler on the One True Way, you know that
            Golconda isn’t about redemption, but about progression
            and mastery. You’ve learned much about the darkness
            within yourself and others. Taming the Beast is agonizing,
            and it resists at every turn, but you work at it the best
            you can. You know there’s times when the Beast must run
            free, but you take heart in knowing even this is under your
            control. You know the benefits of confession, which sooths
            the spirit and gives you secrets to hold over your friends
            and enemies. You hope you can fully understand your
            place as a human predator, and that one night your higher
            instincts and your Hunger will work in tandem.

                                                 ( M A L K AV I A N C H A R A C T E R S O N L Y )




              S      tarfall Ranch is well-known as one of the top
                     ranches in the Northeastern United States. Its cat-
                     tle are consistent state fair winners. Its horses have
              been seen at dressages and other equestrian sports events
              around the world. Owning these animals come at a high
              price, and part of that premium involves the quality
              service of Alberta Pennilee and the expert training of a
              man only known as “Dr. Starr.”
                   Starr is Kindred. He serves the One Moon, a faith
              that believes that Clan Malkavian is actually one single
              person, experiencing themselves and the world around
              them through the lives and perspectives of those they
              Embrace. Aside from being a popular grange, Starfall
              Ranch serves as a halfway house for dispossessed Malka-
              vians. There, they can work, feed, and learn their place as
              part of the One Moon.
                   Starfall Ranch plays a major part in your life,
              whether you once worked there after your Embrace,                      Whatever role Starfall Ranch has in your life, one thing
              or you still call it home. You might know the secrets            is for certain. Whenever someone tells you, “you’re a part of
              of Starr’s ranch hands, or the basic philosophies of the         something greater,” you can’t help but shake your head and
              One Moon. Perhaps you had the privilege of meeting the           smile. As you’ve learned on the ranch, that turn of phrase is
              Methuselah that sleeps beneath the farmland.                     truer than the rest of the Kindred could imagine.
