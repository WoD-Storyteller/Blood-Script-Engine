                                                        wears an open long grey coat adorned with silver buttons.
                                                        Underneath the coat, a black velvet shirt peeks through.
                                                        Chest hair protrudes from the low-cut V-neck he wears
                                                        underneath, and around his neck hangs several silvery
                                                        necklaces in an odd mixture of feminine bejeweled pieces,

                                                        and overpower the Darkhour security personnel. They were

              that a family uses it for eating once in a while. If the PCs
              circle around to the back yard, they find it devoid of life
              but for topiary and the ashes of a bonfire with a whole
              bunch of half-destroyed toys and girl’s clothing within it.
                   Light emerges from a couple of windows on the sec-
              ond floor, and the occasional shadow can be seen walking
              by. They differ in size and height and interact with each
              other occasionally. The exterior of the house is a bad mix
              between an old family home and Roman design: There are
              red brick walls and robust, supportive pillars around the
              perimeter. The windows, doors, and trimmings suggest
              modern facilities and simplicity. Yet the façade is flaw-
              lessly painted, and every window is meticulously cleaned
              without any signs of elemental damage. If the PCs take
              time out to study the house from different angles before
              approaching it, they also see two large dog houses in the
              very right-hand corner of the property.
                   In order to get into the house, the PCs must bypass
              the fence and gate. If the PCs try to talk to Redwood
              through the speaker system on the outside of the gate,
              they can hear his distorted voice through the speaker
              system. He greets the PCs in a mocking tone and tells
              them he’ll gladly let them in if they answer a question he
              created for them.
                   “Tell me this, you bloodsucking bastards: How many
              pints can a hundred and ten pound fifteen-year-old girl
              lose before she becomes irrevocably brain damaged?”
                   There’s no definite answer to the question, but Red-
              wood is looking for the vampires to show concern or state
              anywhere between three and five (more than that would
              leave the hypothetical girl dead). The gates slide open if
              they answer in a way that satisfies him, and the PCs have
              access to the property. Of course, they may want to try
              and climb or jump the fence. This can be achieved with
              a successful Dexterity + Athletics roll (Difficulty 4 since

                 The tome potentially responsible for Clan Tremere’s recent fracturing and the severing of Blood Bonds all along
                 America’s West Coast is the Book of the Grave-War. Originally written by some manner of Malkavian blood sor-
                 cerer, it lays down theories relating to breaking bonds with sires, clans, and domitors, and the waking of ancient
                 vampires known as “the Shadow Sleepers.” Only recently has the book drawn widespread Kindred attention due to
                 Carna of Clan Tremere using it to slip free of her clan’s Blood ties and passing on its content to other inclined Kindred.
                 More information can be found in Beckett’s Jyhad Diary and Vampire: The Masquerade p. 385.

            Sneaking Around
                 We Gather Here Tonight gives the coterie chances
            to sneak around, observe the gathering, or try to rescue
            potential sacrifices. This involves Stealth rolls, which the
            players might fail. When that happens, if everyone failed
            their roll, the Storyteller can move straight to The Ritual
            on p. 70. If only some are detected, Starchild gestures to
            the discovered characters to come forward and join the
            Congregation of the Harvest God.
                 “Join us,” the ghoul sings. “My God is great and mag-
            nificent. There’s room for each of you at Its feet. You may
            drink Its enlightenment when It ascends to rule the night.
            What say you?”
                 Any answer that comes down to “no” immediately
            sees Starchild call on the Congregation to attack the
            coterie. But a yes or even hesitation might stall him long
            enough for any undiscovered characters to attempt one
            more task: examine the tree, join with Mariangel, or free
            someone from a garment bag. A Charisma + Etiquette or
            Persuasion opposed by Wits + Subterfuge to keep Starch-
            ild talking could even buy them multiple rounds to act.

            Where is Mariangel?
                 Mariangel, if the coterie didn’t pick her up at the
            start of this chapter, also found her way to the Congre-
            gation of the Harvest God, having finally figured out
            they were killing her discarded prey. She’s not trying to
            hide from the characters, and a Wits + Awareness roll
            (Difficulty 3) spots her sneaking in the corn. If the coterie
            draws her attention and encountered her in Chapter
            Four, she makes her way over to them immediately. Oth-
            erwise she simply watches what happens next. Mariangel’s
            goal is to destroy Starchild, whom she met once before
            and whom she rightly blames for the Congregation mur-
            dering her prey.

            Examining the Tree
                 If they didn’t examine the Judas tree (described on
            p. 60 of Chapter Four), the Kindred might want to do so
            now. Sneaking close enough to examine the soil requires
            a Dexterity + Stealth roll (Difficulty 4), and quickly lets
            the character determine the ground is soaked with blood.
            Examining the tree proper requires Unseen Passage, as
            too many eyes are on the tree. By now the tree is pulsat-
            ing slightly, which any character can feel if they touch its
            trunk. The pulsating is akin to a heartbeat, but slightly
            off — not a living heartbeat, but a faint memory of one.
            Thick red sap mingled with the Harvest God’s blood
            oozes off the bark.

                   Unless the characters have a way to determine which
             bag holds their rescue target (Auspex’s Heightened Senses
             might sniff them out), they need to open bags randomly.
                                                                                   The Ritual
             The Storyteller rolls a dice, increasing the odds of the
             coterie opening the right bag with each roll: 8-10 on                        After the coterie takes two actions (e.g., join with

            Signs of Mortal Distress
                 Indianapolis is a torment for many of the kine
            who live here. Tourists can just pass through, but
            the city’s residents are often pulled between faith
            and politics, with evangelism and Catholicism
            on the rise in this domain. The major issue as far
            as Kindred are concerned is the Ministry’s local
            dominance, with kine selected for membership in
            cults, of which there are many, and expected to give
            up significant parts of their lives to the extortionists
            claiming to be their saviors.
                 Mortal residents of Indianapolis therefore appear
            gaunt, as if fed from or malnourished, and they are
            stressed and twitchy due to the constant buzz of
            preaching in their heads. Some are aggressive, due to
            the dogmatic approach many churches in this domain
            adopt. Though the mortal behavior in Indianapolis is
            no obvious indication as to Honor’s whereabouts, the
            Storyteller should use it to highlight the haggard nature
            of a religious Anarch city.


            Springs Eternal Church
                  Springs Eternal Church in Spring Hill, northern
            Indianapolis, currently serves as the pulpit for “Coach”
            Tyrone Soros (see p. 190), one of the Ministry’s Guides
            and one of their loudest voices in Indianapolis. When
            the PCs arrive, his inspirational, motivational, and to
            his mind, sensational service is in full swing. The small,
            white, wooden church is filled with a congregation of
            clapping, smiling followers.
                  Ty paces back and forth before the church altar,
            bellowing his words into a microphone strapped to his
            lapel. He sounds like an evangelical preacher but dress-
            es like a sports coach, occasionally throwing punches
            and kicks to emphasize his points.
                  A few of his winning lines, riddled with mixed
            metaphors and fueled with Presence, include:
                  “Do you know how you spell recovery? I can’t
            tell you that, but I can tell you there’s no “I” in that
            word. You need mentorship, companionship, and
            God’s own ship, his ark, your ark, to cross that Nile!”
                  “I was once a no-hoper. A loser. I drank. I
            smoked. I took drugs. Do you know what lifted me
            from my funk? Was it therapy? No! Was it television?
            No! Was it antidepressants? Heck, no! It was God! It

            Built on Sand, Forged in Steel
                 It’s Bricks. That’s right. It’s like Rick. But with a B in front of it. And an S
              at the end of it.
                 You can picture it, right? Back in the night, some big conclave in some
              European country. All the big muckety-mucks gathered in some big fancy room.
              You’ve got all the Inner Circle members. You’ve got all the Justicars. And then
              you’ve got this row of Princes. Come roll-call, each one stands up and announc-
              es who they are and what city they rule, accompanied by ten fucking minutes
              of titles and childe-of-such-and-such. Francois Villon, Prince of Paris. Anne
              Bowesley, Prince of London. Lodin, Prince of Chicago. And then you have Modius,
              Prince of Gary, Indiana.
                 Gary-Fucking-Indiana.
                You can just picture them laughing their asses off. Cause really, who would
              want to be Prince of Gary? Truth is, Modius was Prince because that’s exactly
              where Lodin wanted him. Far enough away that he couldn’t really interfere with
              Lodin’s night-to-night activities, but close enough, should he get out of line,
              to stick a Lupine’s head in his bed. Or coffin. Or whatever.
                 So, Gary started as the industrial cornerstone of the Midwest. Some guy
              with the same name founded the United States Steel Corporation there in 1906.
              Things were going well, at least for white folks, until 1919, when you’ve got the
              steel workers’ strike. After 110 days, things broke into a full-scale riot out
              on Broadway. Governor Goodrich declares martial law and sends four thousand
              troops, under the command of Major General Leonard Wood, to restore order. Heads
              are busted, people die, and in the end, workers go back to work.
                We’re chugging along, and then in the late 1960s, it all goes to shit again.
              The steel market collapses. Businesses go bankrupt. Unemployment skyrockets.
              White folk leave the city, but black folk can’t. And really, not much has im-
              proved since then. You went from a population of 180,000 in 1960, down to 80,000
              by 2010. You’ve got rampant political corruption. You’ve got a stretch during the
              Clinton and Bush years where Gary has the highest per capita homicide rate for
              nine years straight. Now, there’s hardly anybody left to kill.
                 You think that happens by accident? You think those dumb fucks in Gary are
              just, what, unlucky? Of course not. It happens cause the vampires in Chicago
              want it that way. Cause they’ve got this hundred-year-old grudge against Modius
              and everything he tried to do. Cause when you fuck with the Prince, you better
              believe the Prince is going to fuck you right back.
                 See, Modius and Lodin were rivals. Modius tried to take over Chicago back in
              1913 and ended up getting pushed back into Gary. So, in 1921, Lodin began what
              he called his Interdiction. He sent two of his kids, Horatio Ballard and Alfonse
              I-shit-you-not Capone, to deal with the problem. Suddenly, they’re auditing busi-
              nesses. Mafiosos are leaning on the unions. City officials take bribes and turn
              eyes. And over the next forty years, this beautiful industrial town transformed
              into the piece of shit it is today. Finally, Modius bent the knee. And while he
              got to keep the crown, he essentially handed his balls on a steel platter to
              Lodin.

    LET THE STREETS RUN RED




                    Fast forward to the War of Chicago. The Sabbat roll in. The Lupines roll in.
                 The Anarchs rally under Juggler. Modius sits back sipping his Toreador blood
                 tea, watching Chicago go up in flames. He thinks this is his chance to take the
                 city. Problem is, everyone thought it was their chance. Modius, Juggler, fuck,
                 even Maxwell comes out of the woodwork to drop his dick on the table. In the
                 end, after the Primogen hold court for close to two decades, Joseph Peterson
                 pulls in every favor he ever collected to take praxis. Which lasts for about
                 three seconds before Jackson takes over.
                    But the struggle didn’t end there. It bled outward, and I guess Juggler
                 thought if he couldn’t have Chicago, he’d settle for Gary. Modius and Juggler
                 go at each other for years, causing enough of a ruckus for the hunters to get
                 wind of it all. Sullivan Dane rolls through, taking out vampires left and
                 right. The FBI’s Special Affairs Division starts snooping around. Fuck, even Gary
                 P.D., in the form of Detective Moore, protégé to the semi-infamous Commissioner
                 Greg Stephens, starts going to town. Everyone hits the deck and when the smoke
                 clears, Modius is dead, Juggler is gone, and the rest of us are left picking up
                 the pieces.




              A Brief History of Gary
                    I am afraid your intelligence is quite out of date, my young friend.
                 However, since you paid my fee, I will elucidate you.

                    It is true Modius was Prince of Gary, in name at least. Having
                 lost multiple gambits against Prince Lodin of Chicago, the Toreador
                 found himself indebted to the Ventrue. This was the culmination of a
                 failed political gambit wherein Modius called in several boons from the
                 Toreador Justicar to arrange a Conclave in Gary. It ended in disaster and
                 reconvened in Chicago the next evening. In a backroom of the Succubus
                 Club and in the presence of the same Justicar, Modius finally ceded to
                 Lodin’s strength.

                    Thereafter, Modius only took actions after first consulting with Lodin.
                 However, this was often done by way of his sire Annabelle, who sits as the
                 Toreador Primogen to this night. By 1999, the Camarilla population of Gary
                 was quite small: Modius, his childe Allicia, myself, young Charlie, and a
                 scant few others. Lucian died a horrible death. Liev too. Miserable ends.
                 Juggler and his cohorts populated the rest of the city.

                    Juggler is, or perhaps was, a typical Brujah Anarch. Dramatic, bold,
                 and charismatic in his own fashion, Juggler spent the past decades
                 building an army, drawing from the young, disenfranchised Anarchs of Gary
                 and Chicago.

                    But Gary is and remains a dead city. The private war between Modius
                 and Juggler only succeeded in bleeding it dry. Those Kindred who found
                 themselves here struggled to survive draining the blood of their victims
                 from night to night or engaged in petty feuds over territory. Violence
                 begat violence, and the city has become a reflection of that chaos.

                                                                                          Rusted Jungle




                 Then Juggler suddenly found himself an audience beyond the meager
              borders of Gary. Filmed in Gary during the winter of 2012, a Hollywood
              zombie movie depicted the overthrow of the aristocracy and the general
              fall of civilization. The protagonists, a group of young and rebellious
              anarchists, fought off the zombies and saved the day. Given the film’s
              subtle stab at the Camarilla, the movie garnered the attention of Anarchs
              in the West Coast Free States, who spotted Juggler’s metaphorical
              fingerprints all over it. As a result, the Hollywood Anarchs requested
              Juggler gain full recognition for his efforts and ensured that he took
              the mantle of Baron of Gary. This act emboldened the local Anarchs, which
              resulted in even more bloodshed.

                 Oddly enough, the Anarchs up in Chicago did not fall into line,
              viewing Juggler as too arrogant and self-serving. What followed was
              altogether tragic, but not entirely unexpected. Modius dispatched his
              ghouls to target Juggler’s followers. Corrupt police found themselves
              torn between the two elders. The two major gangs within the city, the
              Glen Park 45ers and the Knights, shot at each other on the city streets
              in broad daylight. And once again in 2013, Gary earned the bloody
              notoriety of being the Murder Capital — per capita — of the United
              States.

                 Both Modius and Juggler reached out to their allies in Chicago,
              but none of them wanted to involve themselves in the fray. So, Modius
              escalated the matter. Through a series of cut-outs and go-betweens,
              Modius sent word to the great vampire hunter, Sullivan Dane, and placed a
              box of intelligence in his proverbial lap. Names, dates, locations, the
              works. All marked with a big red X and a tied up in a lovely black bow.

                 During the summer of 2014, Dane wiped out Kindred left and right.
              Zakariah. Travers. Eloise. He was relentless. Most of us went into
              hiding, waiting for the storm to pass. But then a mouthy ghoul let it
              slip that Modius was the one responsible. Support for the pauper Prince
              of Gary evaporated overnight. Rumor has it that his own childe, Allicia,
              handed Modius over to Juggler. Most people believe the Anarchs killed
              him right then and there. But that is not the truth. In a surprising
              display of cunning and foresight, Juggler secretly reached out to Modius’
              sire, Annabelle, and worked out a deal. In exchange for a series of boons
              and the promise Chicago would not interfere with the Free City of Gary,
              Juggler swore to spare Modius’ life. She agreed, and the Anarchs placed
              Modius under arrest.

                 That is how Juggler managed to claim the mantle of Baron of Gary.
              Right up until he disappeared, too.

                 That was a month ago. Juggler’s childe, Evelyn Stephens, has filled
              the void and runs the Anarchs in Gary. As for the rest of the usual
              suspects, Charlie vanished. Lucian migrated east. Most of us presume
              someone executed Modius without Juggler to protect him. And a young blood
              Camarilla by the name of Sharpe showed up on the west side of the city,
              claiming a chunk of territory for himself. And as I exit the stage, never
              to return to this rusted carcass of a city, Sullivan Dane, the hunter of
              legend, continues to stalk the streets of Gary.

                  This story allows for one of the player characters to act as a double agent. This may put the coterie at cross purposes
                  but lends itself to enhanced drama and outcomes that are more variable. If the players are Anarchs attempting to
                  infiltrate the Camarilla, implement this via a private text to one of the players from Damien, the Brujah Sheriff of
                  Chicago, which reads simply: “Jackson knows you met with the Center and why. Deal with this problem in Gary
                  and report to me instead. Jackson will double whatever Wainwright is offering.” The player can choose to share this
                  counteroffer with the other players or keep it to themselves.
                  Conversely, if the players are Camarilla attempting to infiltrate the Anarchs, Wainwright can text instead, if she would
                  have their number. “The Center is aware of Damien’s plan. If you don’t want your cover blown, investigate the situation
                  in Gary and report back to me.” Wainwright can also offer the double agent a similar deal to the one listed above.
                  Again, the double agent can choose to share this new information with their fellow players or keep it secret.

                  Lieutenant Detective Moore is an exceptional police officer devoted to
                  her work (at the expense of two marriages). Her patient, inquisitive
                  quality lends itself well to detective work. Generally a quiet and re-
                  served individual, Lieutenant Detective Moore appears to have the re-
                  spect of her peers with an above average clearance rate and a below av-
                  erage number of complaints and reprimands.

                                                    years of Operation Enduring Freedom. He’s since retired and

                                                     hair. His left ring finger has no ring, imprint, or tan line.

                                                      a dark fantasy about what it might feel like to kill someone.
                                                      He’s trying to transfer over to the personal security division of

    LET THE STREETS RUN RED




              Handout #2: A Letter

                   Those responsible for events in Gary,
                While I am no friend to you or your kind, my battle is not with
              you. Demons of higher rank walk these streets, warring with one
              another. I have observed from the outside, warmed by the light of
              God and fed by His Righteousness. To that end, having witnessed
              your work, I offer you my deepest thanks. For while your motives
              may be your own, there are fewer godless monsters today than there
              were yesterday.
                I will allow you to walk the streets of Gary unmolested, and
              I will ensure my fellow hunters do the same. But if you violate
              one of God’s Holy Commandments, then know I will withdraw my
              protection. Harm the virtuous or abuse the innocent, and I shall
              hunt you down and drag you before the sun. For in this secret war
              of yours, there are forces greater than you know. And in His name,
              I will not hesitate to enlighten you.
                   Sincerely,
                   Sullivan Dane

                    Iacopo Manzini was the second son of a prosper-
              ous merchant family. He attended excellent schools
              and graduated from the University of Vicenza in 1840.
              Fascinated by politics, he enthusiastically participated in
              the revolutionary movement. His family, disapproving of
              his dangerous ideas, wanted him to settle down, marry,
              and work in the family business, but that was not the
              life Iacopo envisioned for himself. After a series of bitter

            had gotten to see at a tender age. His schooling consisted of
            him learning the classics from the viewpoint of nature and
            relating them to the natural world. He kept a journal of his
            travels and started documenting his journey by describing           encounters, and learned through reading and experience

                                 “It’s high time we embraced a higher calling than endless squabbles over this block or that.”

                                            — Keisha Phelps, explaining the futility of the Eternal Struggle

                   Indianapolis stands as one of the first Ministry-con-
              trolled domains in the United States and has grown as an
              ostensibly neutral territory as a result. The Ministry are
              anything but neutral, however. They watch, they listen,
              and they manipulate every affair.

                Quote: “How strong is your faith? Strong enough
                to resist me? What chains bind you? Let me set you
                free.”

              MORTAL DAYS: THE BEAUTIFUL VOICE
                   Keisha loved to sing, and she loved to praise the
              Lord. Her father’s work as minister at the Church of the
              Holy Gospel Spirit allowed her voice to reach hundreds
              on a Sunday. She wished people wouldn’t make such a
              fuss about it. She knew her voice was a gift from God,
              and she knew God didn’t care whether she sang in the                   They seem Godless to her. She still hears the voice of God

              God spoke to her quite clearly and told her so.                        she did not enjoy the punishing quite so much.
                   Her father had one theory about what God wanted                        Her education in Kindred society and the Ministry
              and her mother had another. Keisha found her own. God                  came from Melvyn Ramsay, leader of the Ministry in

                My Dearest Nazeera,
                I am sure you are aware how much it pains me that
                you remain stuck in the past, determined to cele-
                brate your bondage to the Pyramid which, I can
                assure you, is doomed to fall. I find it incomprehen-
                sible that you stand by such a patriarchal structure.
                I cannot understand why you would follow Herr
                Schrekt rather than a woman of your own blood.
                Something, somewhere, must have gone wrong.
                Annais was always faithful. And where is she now,
                I wonder?
                Personal issues aside, I need to you do some work
                for me in Milwaukee. I fear the library will come
                under attack. Guard it well for me, Nazeera. Seek
                help where you can. Many will follow me, most will
                follow me. So, though I find your betrayal difficult
                to tolerate, you may still serve me well, childe of
                my Blood.
                Your loving ancestor, Carna

    LET THE STREETS RUN RED




                                                         THE A NUBI
                   The Lupine attack on Chicago is a stark reminder
              of how vulnerable Kindred are to werewolf assault. The
              Princes of the Camarilla looked to Milwaukee, and its
              guardians the Anubi, for a solution. Led by Milwaukee’s
              Prince, Mark Decker, the Anubi are the Camarilla’s
              premier force of Lupine hunters. They are well organized,
              well equipped, and determined to repulse every Lupine
              incursion into the city.
                   Other cities began emulating Milwaukee’s model
              with mixed results. Many coteries failed due to inexperi-
              ence or left their posts when Clan Gangrel abandoned the
              Camarilla. Others overthrew their Princes or became the
              kingmakers of their domain. A few even sided with the
              Anarchs, defending the Baronies of the Free States and
              newly acquired Anarch cities.
                   More successful Princes recruited Gangrel with
              greater loyalty to their city than to their clan, or built
              mixed-membership coteries by offering money, special
              privileges, hunting rights, or boons. Even the legendary           or the all-Ventrue “Hunt Club” of Quebec, maintain the
              Anubi had to offer grants of hunting grounds to young              Anubi’s militant structure and battle Lupines nightly. Oth-

            the quiet strength of the enigmatic vampire that dotingly
            watched over “Portia” all those nights. Fewer still realize
            that Eletria was once Prince of Veracruz and one of the
            most talented artists in history. Born of Sparta, reborn of
            Helena, Eletria travelled the world, drowning herself in
            life’s myriad pleasures and always returned panting for
            more. Painting, sculpture, and music came effortlessly to
            her. The Kindred of Veracruz bent their knees to her will
            and were better for her presence. Her very passions con-
            quered the hearts of all who met her, ensnaring Lodin’s
            sire, Datura, then Lodin himself, loving and losing both

    LET THE STREETS RUN RED




               KINDRED SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCER
                   Sometimes it’s worth risking the ire of those elders
              who have banned social media use, especially for fledg-
              lings Embraced in recent nights. Though the Second
              Inquisition makes having an online presence dangerous
              for vampires, having a large internet following brings
              potential benefits: information, influence, money, and
              food. When the choice is between feeding on a flash mob
              participant or frenzying from hunger, you pick the one
              that isn’t a sure breach of the Masquerade.
                   Often, a vampire can entirely avoid mentioning
              Kindred lifestyles on their social feeds. Maybe their Insta-
              gram account is all pictures of books artfully posed beside
              glasses of wine, or their Twitter timeline consists only
              of cat memes and dad jokes. Throughout the centuries,
              vampires have adopted mortal personas that give no whiff
              of their nighttime pursuits. Tonight’s fledglings aim to do
              the same, only with more likes, favorites, and followers.

                                                      JUGGLER
                 Juggler has been a pain in the Chicago Camarilla’s
            ass and a thorn in Modius’s side for the better part of
            a century. He ruled the Anarchs before Maldavis came
            along, and he directed much of their activity from Gary.
            During some of the tensest periods in the War of Chica-
            go, Helena and the powerful Brujah Tyler controlled his
            actions. Juggler may have a sense of this, especially since
            Tyler’s disappeared from Chicago, but it’s not something
            he’d ever let slip to his followers.
                 In recent nights, he’s orchestrated the Anarchs’
            takeover of Gary, relishing his rival Modius’s rage as the
            pauper Prince’s power ebbed away. Rumor had it he’d
            triumphantly captured Modius — whose own childe
            turned Anarch and gave him up — and may at last have
            destroyed his enemy. This move made Juggler the Baron of
            Gary at last, but a month into his reign, he disappeared.
                 Unlike his disorganized Camarilla counterpart,
            Juggler understands how to run a revolution. His childe,
            Evelyn Stephens, was privy to his plans. He kept some se-
            crets, but he ensured that the schemes he’d set in motion        to the Anarchs to lose their leader, Evelyn has stepped up
            could carry on in his absence. As much of a blow as it was       and rallied them right back to the cause.

              does not function (see p. 231). Then Carna abandoned
              Milwaukee on the eve of a Sabbat invasion, and her fellow
              chantry members, Victor and Dr. Mortius, disappeared
              soon after. The Tremere have not reestablished their

                                          M A RK DECK ER
                 Mark Decker prefers hunting Lupines to ruling Mil-
            waukee. He uses the position to protect the city, placing
            his Anubi in top-ranking jobs and strictly enforcing the
            Masquerade. In recent nights, he’s grown even more sus-
            picious of the Kindred in his territory — who’s plotting
            against him? Who’s undermining his agenda? Breaking
            his strict new laws results in swift punishment, up to and
            including the final death.
                 He trusts very few people outside of his inner circle,
            and even those he watches warily. After all, he was unpre-
            pared both for Carna’s exodus from Milwaukee and his
            clan’s defection from the Camarilla. Who else, he won-
            ders, is ready to turn on him? On occasion, he reaches
            out to Inyanga in Chicago to seek an outside perspective
            on local matters. These nights, those communications are
            fewer and longer between.
                 Decker keeps his city on constant high alert against
            werewolves and Anarchs, and respects those Kindred who
            display the same vigilance he does. Perhaps some night,
            if he can push the Lupines back far enough and strike a             his throne. But that’s a long, long way off, and there’s
            massive blow to the Anarchs, he’d consider relinquishing            much work to be done before then.


                                                                       LORE

                                                        MAXWELL
                    Maxwell’s been off the chess board a long time now.
              The one-time Prince of Chicago, a Brujah, might have ruled
              again after Lodin’s death, were it not for Kevin Jackson’s
              rise to power. He disappeared after that, though wise Kin-
              dred know better than to think he’s suffered his final death.
                    In fact, Maxwell still considers himself Chicago’s
              Prince, and suggests Kevin Jackson’s merely keeping the
              throne warm. He’s gotten a better handle on the mod-
              ern world these last few years and dedicated time and
              resources to quietly shoring up his support. He still holds
              sway with Chicago PD’s Internal Affairs. In recent nights,
              he’s focused on building up the Vanguard, a group of
              Camarilla based in Gary, Indiana, who are loyal to him
              and his play for praxis. Gary is little more than a staging
              ground to him, a place from which to launch his strikes
              against Chicago before he reclaims his throne.
                    Maxwell’s opponents (and many of his supporters)
              recognize his penchant for violence. Signing on with him
              is a dangerous and probably bloody endeavor, but he’ll
              handsomely reward those who help him take Chicago.

                                                                          LORE

                 The “Null Zone” is a mystical dead zone centered on
            Marquette University and the surrounding area where
            magic simply ceases to function. This site was once the
            location of the final battle between the Lupine Usla and,
            Hrothulf’s Kindred wife, Chiclena and her allies. With his
            dying breath, Usla called upon the mighty spirits of his
            people, transforming parts of his very being into a pair
            of potent talismans, destroying Chiclena. Almost no one
            knows these talismans are buried under Marquette Uni-
            versity, or that they are responsible for creating the “Null
            Zone.” Kindred, Lupines, and magi study the Zone with
            great vigor, but few outside the Lupines know its secret.

            not for lack of trying — he’s gone to war for Chicago. He vies
            to lift Gary from the mire Lodin sank it into. He’s yanked
            the city back from Juggler and his Anarchs time and again.
                  Modius could be transcendent, if only his fellow
            Kindred opened their eyes.
                  Though many vampires dismiss Modius as a pauper
            Prince, he’s done his damnedest to revive Gary, even
            as his enemies in Chicago push it deeper into decline.
            He’s built up alliances in the city he rules and gathered
            followers who admire him — or who at least lie about it
            convincingly. He keeps up correspondence with his sire,
            Toreador Primogen Annabelle, keeping her abreast of his
            achievements should she spot an opportunity for him in
            Chicago. His letters go mostly unanswered.
                  These nights, Modius’s name is most often whispered
            alongside his long-standing enemy, Juggler. The two revel
            in their ongoing hostilities, letting their violent conflict
            add to Gary’s already abominable crime rate.

             MORTAL DAYS: LIFE ON THE ROAD
                   After Veronica’s father died when she was very
             young, her mother sold their family home in the Indiana
             suburbs and landed a job as an acrobat in the traveling
             circus, which meant young Veronica spent her childhood
             growing up on the road. She spent her days learning hula
             hoop dancing and other tricks from the performers she
             traveled with. She got particularly close to a fire-spinner
             named Tabitha who was a little rough around the edges
             but was one of the few who didn’t treat Veronica like a
             child. While Veronica’s mother was often too busy being
             a star to pay her much attention, Veronica and her new
             friend spent most evenings together, practicing togeth-

             worries about — like her desire for nicer clothes and her
             hopes for the future. Unbeknownst to Veronica, she was
