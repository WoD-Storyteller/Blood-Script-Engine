One-Roll Conflicts
a conflict need not necessarily be resolved
as a “zoomed in” series of exchanges as in the basic
rules. It can also be resolved in a more “zoomed out”
manner, especially if it holds less potential for drama
or involves fewer players. (Or incidentally, if it involves
too many actors to turn into a meaningful conflict!)
One-roll conflicts can resolve any sort of conflict,
from a relentless brawl to a night of trading bon mots
and compliments at the Succubus Club.

its power. Each player participating in the conflict
