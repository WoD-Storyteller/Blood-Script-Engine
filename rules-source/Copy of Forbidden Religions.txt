    FORBIDDEN RELIGIONS




            Hierarchy
                 Ur-Shulgi himself disappeared in the last decade,
            claiming to be on a pilgrimage from which he intends
            to return with powers beyond that which he possessed
            before. Before his departure, he personally appointed his
            heralds and decreed no one had the right to remove them
            from their roles. The rest of his cult hierarchy resulted
            from the dispersal of the faith across the globe. While
            members of the cult use the same titles everywhere, the
            functions of the positions vary considerably in accord-
            ance with conditions on the ground.

            Heralds
                 The twelve heralds have a broad remit: to bring
            primarily the Banu Haqim and secondarily other
            vampires back to the laws of Haqim. Those Ur-Shulgi
            chose were ancilla of considerable age. In the begin-
            ning, they tried traditional methods of conversion
            by the sword, which they swiftly found to be risky
            and ineffective. The twelve did not remain in close
            communication with one another and, as a matter of
            course, developed different methods of conversion and
            different takes on the laws. While sticking to their
            principles, they have adapted to local conditions.
                 Garnering little success in converting devotees of
            other religions, most heralds have taken to seeking out
            doubters and apostates, particularly those who crave a
            source of certainty. They find an enthusiastic audience
            among the thin-bloods. More than once, a herald has
            aided a thin-blood in diablerizing one of the Ashirra and
            attaining the 13th generation.
                 Twelve heralds were insufficient to manage the
            cult on their own, especially as most of them were
            peripatetic, moving from city to city. Furthermore,              Lugalme of the White Tongue. Others, such as Naram-Sin

            acceptance of the Ashirra into the Camarilla, the
            unlife of Ur-Shulgi’s followers has become even more
            precarious in domains where the sect has influence.

                was almost completely obscured. A tax fraud scandal
                in the ‘80s left the building in a legal limbo from
                which it has yet to emerge. Now, it is abandoned
                and ill-guarded. A blight on an otherwise beautiful
                historic district, Molinero has taken it over and
                cleaned it up, claiming legal ownership to anyone
                who asks and signing the building as a by-appoint-
                ment spa/wellness center. The built-up architecture
                of the place makes its basements a maze to anyone
                not familiar with the layout, and multiple feet of
                concrete soundproof certain rooms, which are also
                conveniently difficult to escape.

            •   Southtown (Influence (Neighborhood) 2, Herd 2,
                Retainers 3) Santiago has inherited connections in
                this fashionable residential and arts district from his
                sire, who cultivated contacts and a handful of ghouls
                among the neighborhood association and business
                improvement district and supplemented them with
                his own influence in the high-end drug-dealing scene.
                A steady stream of tourists provides food and fodder
                for the cult’s rituals, augmented when necessary by
                wealthy drug-using homemakers and business profes-
                sionals living nearby.

            •   Predator Type: Consensualist (Willing Disciples)
                Santiago convinces the mortals who follow in the
                Soldiers’ wake that his kiss is a blessing and a form of
                sacrament. It doesn’t hurt that he ensures that they
                physically enjoy the experience.

            KINDRED RELATIONSHIPS:
            •   Viki Palmer (Rivalry) Palmer believes that she
                should be more than a simple Soldier for the Adver-
                sary; she should be the Devil’s General. Based in the
                domain of Houston, she eyes Santiago’s cult in San
                Antonio as a mark to be extinguished in favor of her
                own brand of infernal worship.

            •   Annazir (Puppeteer) A vampire by the name of
                Annazir recently woke from beneath the streets of
                San Antonio, and has yet to feel the pull of the Beck-
                oning. This old vampire’s first contact with fellow
                Kindred in the modern nights was with Molinero
                and his cult. Annazir presently plays them along,
                presenting himself as one of the Devil’s seraphs, and
                enjoys the cult’s fealty. He belongs to an old blood-
                line, long believed destroyed, and has many plans for
                the Soldiers of the Adversary. Hell is coming, and
                Annazir intends for this cult to act as vanguard.

                             BLOOD A SCETICISM
             I   f blood is an addiction for the Kindred, then it’s no
                 surprise that some vampires try to kick the habit.
                 Of course, you can’t just go cold turkey; that’s a
             quick route to torpor, or ravenous frenzy and waking
             up covered in someone else’s blood. Those who take this
             endeavor seriously model themselves on mortal ascetics,
             trying to slowly starve their Beast into submission or to
             reduce their reliance on the red stuff over years or even
             centuries. Some see it as a potential path to Golconda.
                  Blood asceticism is a harsh path to follow, demand-
             ing the vampire reject the satisfaction and pleasure of
             sanguine satiation. This requires great willpower, and
             practitioners often resort to distracting their hungry
             Beast through the agony of self-mortification or fully
             embrace isolation and privation. Most Kindred reject
             such asceticism out of hand, since those who succeed are
             usually starving hermits and those who fail serve as fear-
             some lessons in the folly of denying your hunger when
             they snap and go on a rampage.

             the world comes apart at the seams. While some deride
             the notion of Gehenna as an invention for duping the
             guileless, a feverish millenarianism has gripped many
             Kindred with the belief that these are indeed the Final
             Nights, one way or another. Blood cults and heresies
             spring up from the shadows in ever-growing numbers.
                  The creeds of these new blood cults come in a
             dizzying variety of hatreds, anxieties, and hungers. The
             most successful spread their black wings from one city
             to the next, forming something like a cohesive doctrine
             even as feuding Kindred splinter off new schisms and
             heresies. Charting out the spread of such subversive
             elements requires an agile mind to keep track of the
             shifting tapestry, not to mention a strong stomach even
             by vampire standards. All too many Gehenna cults delve
             into stomach-churning practices.

                       PL AGU ES OF GEHE N NA
             V        ampire and disease have been intertwined
                      since the dawn of time. It’s inevitable; the
                      blood-drinking parasite spreads sickness
             with her bite, weakens her victims before the advent
             of illness, and in a very real way is a disease upon the
             heaving throng of humanity. Minor cults of Kindred who
             embrace this ruinous connection have emerged through-
             out history, but the tumultuous modern nights see many
             more such plaguebringers springing up than ever before.
                   The most base and simplistic of these cults embrace
             disease at the most literal level, believing that vampires
             are the harbingers of plague upon humanity and that
             they must spread sickness to usher in — or finish off —
             Gehenna itself. More sophisticated groups like the Third
             Day develop elaborate nuances or justifications, con-
             necting disease upon the kine with the Beckoning that
             now seizes elders, or hoping to afflict Kindred them-
             selves through corrupting the herd upon which they                tainted vitae, and swarms of flies. It’s no wonder that
             feed. Whatever the reasoning, the outcome is usually the          most sect-aligned Kindred try to stamp out blisters as
             same; heaps of putrefying bodies, vampires retching up            soon as possible.

                                                    (T R E M E R E CH A R ACT E R S ON LY )




             Y       ou’re a Praepositor, one of the militant Tremere
                     of the Praesidium devoted to restoring the clan’s
                     old power — by force, if necessary. The cult looks
             back to the Pyramid of authority and blood that once
             united Clan Tremere as the ideal to which they must
             once again aspire, but the realities of the modern nights
             demand that they adapt if they are to achieve this goal.
             Praepositors have become eldritch soldiers of fortune,
             trading their services for the occult and secular resources
             the House needs.
                   House and clan need you, and you stand ready to
             answer their call. Your every success reinforces Praesid-
             ium’s position within the Camarilla, but Praepositors
             aren’t picky; your superiors expect you to take up con-
             tracts with Anarchs or even in domains of Autarkis, if
             it serves the cult’s purposes. As for the old Blood Bonds
             that once tied the clan together, the Praesidium sees
             their restoration as one of its end goals — and expects
             you to act with the same devotion and swiftness as those
             bonds once assured.

             C        lan scholars believe that Artemis Orthia is the
                      first childe of Ventrue, and say that she once
                      held sway over Sparta in the guise of its patron
             goddess. She burned with the desire to destroy her foes
             and acted decisively — but her headstrong hunger for
             conflict would prove her downfall at the hands of the
             Brujah of Carthage. The cultists of the Shattered Spear
             venerate this ancestor-figure, hiding in the shadows of
             Clan Ventrue and conducting their worship in defiance
             of Camarilla dictates. Now the cult waxes in strength
             and gathers new adherents to its banner, drawn by the
             whispered gospel of Artemis’ divine nature and the
             rediscovery of her torpid remains.
                  You are a member of the Shattered Spear, a descend-
             ant of Orthia, and a believer in the sacred nature of your
             forebearer. Carrying the torch of the Spear means that you
             are a warrior, and the cult expects you to fight against the
             Second Inquisition, the Sabbat, and any other groups that
             threaten Kindred society. You are to revile passive indo-
             lence, but your peers and leaders laud your decisive action
             and willingness to spring into battle.

                                                 How dreadful, how perverse, how malicious would a Kindred
                                             faith need to be, to be considered “forbidden”?

                                                 Within this book you will learn of religions stricken from the
                                             records of vampire scholars. Within, you shall find a collection
                                             of beliefs, some pernicious enough to collapse domains, others so
                                             focused that they possess only a handful of coteries the world over.

                                                Each faith is clandestine.

                                                Each religion is taboo.

                                                 Cainites consider these beliefs anathematic to the fragile exist-

                                             members of these cults: they plot, they survive, and they worship
                                             in secret. If they do not, they will surely be hunted to their final
                                             deaths, as threatened archons and Princes seek to silence their
                                             forbidden thoughts.

                                                         Forbidden Religions includes:
                                             • A wide selection of belief systems, some widespread and
                                               cloaked in secrecy, others extreme in their focus, from
                                               Golconda-seekers and Gehenna cults to infernal religions
                                               and churches dedicated to methuselahs.

                                             • New powers, rituals, and coterie types befitting these
                                               religions.

                                             • New optional Loresheets, Merits, and Flaws, for use at
                                               character creation or to build into your characters as they
