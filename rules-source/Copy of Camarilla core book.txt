                          This is a work of speculative horror fiction, set in a dark reflection of our own world. Thus it contains
                         graphic depictions of sex, blood-drinking, drugs, violence, abuse, political oppression, coercion, occultism,
                         heresy and many other potentially upsetting themes. Recommended for mature readers and players. For
                           advice on considerate play and how to handle sensitive themes in tabletop roleplaying games, see the
                                section "Considerate play" in the PDF version of the "Vampire: The Masquerade" rulebook.

              introduction
                             My Dear Childe,

                             Kindred.
                             What a beautiful word.




                             W
                                           hen you became one of us, you may have thought of other words. "Vampire" is a
                                           favorite of mortal mythmakers. "Lick" shows the vital vulgarity of the Anarchs.
                                           Such words are no longer adequate. You are Kindred.
                                 Your first change was physical. You tasted the Blood of the Embrace and became a vam-
                             pire. What you must understand is that this is merely the first step. The first Embrace.
                                 The second Embrace is when you truly become Kindred, when you are initiated into the
                             Camarilla, the greatest society of immortals the world has ever known.
                                 It was not always like this. When I became one of us, a long time ago, the Camarilla still
                             labored under the frankly ridiculous notion it could gather all those of the Blood under its lov-
                             ing care.
                                 This was never the reality and I'm glad the lie has finally been abolished. The protection
                             of the Camarilla is now reserved for those deserving it, and thus a singular Embrace has been
                             separated into two.

                             Turn or Die
                             The first Embrace is physical, the second social, but they share one thing in common. Neither
                             can be refused. Once invited to join the Camarilla, you accept or die for good.
                                You made the wise choice, my childe. The only choice. As I knew you would.




                                                                7

   CAMARILLA




                           I know you have many questions. Why did I bring you into the night? Why did I leave you to fend
                      for yourself for a decade before coming to get you? Why did I choose this moment to induct you into
                      the Camarilla? This letter and the documents within are meant to help you make sense of it all.
                           I will answer the simple questions first. I Embraced you and abandoned you to see if you could
                      make it. The Camarilla is full of the wastrel childer of the powerful, the scions of Justicars, Princes,
                      Inner Circle members, and other luminaries. I would never presume to question their judgement in
                      choosing who they Embrace, but I decided to follow a different path.
                           There is a reason we speak of the first and the second Embrace. I am sure you have cursed me
                      during the many confused, lonely nights of the last decade, but you will thank me when you go to your
                      first Elysium fortified with at least some independent understanding of what it means to subsist on
                      blood and exist outside the human herd.
                           Why did I come to you now, only to disappear? Well, I have a wedding to attend. You will under-
                      stand in time. Consider this another test: If you survive your first week in the Camarilla with only
                      these notes to help you, you will have proven yourself yet again.
                           I suppose you also want to know why I chose you specifically. The truth is, I didn't. I got permis-
                      sion to bring a new childe to the Camarilla, so I instructed my servants to find good candidates. They
                      found five. I Embraced all of them. I know the Prince would probably not have accepted this, but she
                      owes me too much to complain even if she finds out. One of the five ended himself after a week. An-
                      other joined a depressing little Anarch gang where she is still scraping by, as far as I know. Two were
                      destroyed in Second Inquisition raids.
                           You were the one who succeeded in taking control of your new existence. I am sentimental in
                      many things, but when I give my Blood to someone, I want them to be worth it.



                      Welcome
                      I have opened the door for you, but you must enter on your own. I have made you a member of the Cama-
                      rilla, but you must seize upon the opportunity and make it mean something.
                           The Camarilla is power, connections, protection. This is one of the great lessons learned by the power-
                      ful among kine and Kindred alike: Secrecy must always trump vanity. Human billionaires live in seclusion,
                      their estates protected by armies of security guards. They travel by plane and helicopter, invisible to human-
                      ity at large, except for a few extravagant individuals who become targets of hate.
                           Most of the very rich keep a low profile, preferring to stay anonymous. In this and many other
                      ways, there is not much difference between us and them. The Camarilla merely represents another
                      layer of power at the very top. We too live in secrecy, hidden from the general population in our
                      havens and Elysiums. Indeed, often the land of wealth is our land, the privileges society grants to its
                      richest members protecting us too.
                           The Camarilla can be many things. Different cities organize in their own ways, their Kindred shaping
                      their existence according to necessity and desire. Yet, so often wealth and influence are the two constants.
                           We disappear into the human elite, so it is not only the world of the Camarilla you must adjust to. It is
                      also the world of cocktail parties, gala openings, and fundraisers. Pretty much the only avenue blocked to us
                      is going golfing during daytime. And anyway, golf bores me.
                           The Camarilla protects you from many things, but do not be naive about the environment you are about
                      to enter. Despite its profession of peace, the Elysium can be lethal, and frankly we like it like that. Playing the
                      political game is what makes life worth living, and it is only fitting that the price of failure is death.
                           After you have learned everything in these papers, destroy them. It is a good habit to learn. Every docu-
                      ment can betray you in the wrong hands. My servants have been instructed to provide you with access to
                      my havens, including the ones in the city, the mansion, as well as my island cabin. There are also a few

                 apartments that have not been lightproofed. I suggest you sell them. You will also gain access to my ac-
                 counts, offshore holding companies, and financial advisors. The advisors need a steady supply of vitae.
                     You will have most of the things I will not be taking with me, but not everything. All Kindred need a
                 secret or two...
                     I have arranged an invitation to the Elysium for you. Consider the impression you want to make. These
                 people are the ones you will share your eternity with. In time, you will love and hate each and every one of
                 them. You will be bored of them, and happy to have someone who understands you. Keep it in mind when
                 you feel like making enemies.



                 Drink Deep
                 You must love the Camarilla and all it can do for you, more than you have ever loved anything in your life.
                 You must bask in its casual corruption and insincere compliments, its constant backstabbing and eternal en-
                 nui. It senses weakness, Anarch sympathies, aversion to power, and seeks to expel such failures.
                      Like the Embrace, real immortality comes in two parts. Many only understand the first, physical
                 manifestation of it. Yet it also has another side: Immortality means not dying, to put it banally.
                 Most unbound are extinguished younger than they would have died as humans. They die of
                 an inquisitor's stake or the fangs of a Sheriff. They die in the sun and in the sewers. They die
                 because our life is dangerous and they do not have the right protection.
                     In a way, immortality is a lie. When I was human, society was organized into the aristocracy,
                 the trades, the peasants, the clergy. Everyone was supposed to be happy in their place, but many
                 aspired to better things. This sowed the seeds of revolution, because revolution was the only way
                 they could improve their lives. In modern nights, the mortals have become smarter. They say
                 that everyone has a chance to become one of the elite, so people forget that most never do. The
                 opportunity blinds them to the reality. The immortality of the blood works the same way. Young
                 Anarchs think they will live forever, when in fact they will not even make it a few months.
                     You are a true Camarilla immortal. You will go on. Protected by the full might of the Ivory
                 Tower and our ancient laws, you can reach your full potential.
                     Through the centuries, you will gain amazing wealth and power. You will lose it all and find
                 yourself on your knees, only to rise again. You will serve and rule, win and lose, for this is the
                 real secret of the Camarilla: In the long run, the only thing that matters is whether you can still
                 play the game.
                     Immortality means that survival is victory.
                     Once I have settled into my new life, perhaps I will come back to you. You can expect me in a
                 year, a decade, a century. I want to see my domain expanded, my business holdings grown. Most
                 of all, I expect to find a childe who has used my legacy to make something of themselves.
                     The Blood is a gift. Even if you choose to hate me, put it to a good use.

                 Your loving sire,

          We are a monolithic and ruthless cabal, expanding and maintain-
          ing our sphere of influence with hidden hands. We infiltrate rather
           than invade, subvert before we debate, intimidate without asking
            our lessers their opinions. Our power flies on incubus wings by
           night instead of marching with armies by day. Nothing can stand
                   in our way, as none can stand athwart a shadow.




                                                                 REPORT #68
          S O C I A L S TAT U S

          Recent research implies that a blankbody forming part of the secret
          society called “the Tower” or “the Camarilla” is more well-regarded
          than one not of this clique. Within their society, higher-ranking
          blankbodies adopt regal titles: “Prince,” “King,” or, in the case
          of Subject #7, “Emperor.” Other blankbodies defer to members of the
          Tower, bringing to mind an elite caste.
             To date, we have discovered no physical distinction between
          blankbodies within the Tower and those without. However, analysis
          indicates (see attached Report #27AL) that the network provides
          ongoing support for concealing blankbody identities and activities,
          and likely provides its own intelligence and analysis to favored
          members. Those outside are therefore more likely to be exposed, or
          expose themselves, creating targets of opportunity for our action.
             Assuming blankbodies operate along human psychological param-
          eters, membership within the Tower likely provides a sense of worth
          and belonging, as with normal organizations. Although data remain
          fragmentary, the Tokyo and Belem studies indicate that blankbodies
          outside the Tower tend to self-exterminate (or act out so aggres-
          sively as to invite termination) at much higher rates than those
          within it.
             Analysts remain unclear on the cause of this phenomenon: the
                                                                                R243 #68




          Tower seems unlikely to offer psychological care to its members,
          but if internal surveillance characterizes its discipline perhaps
          divergence is tantamount to betrayal. One possibility: blankbod-
          ies within this group adopt a mindset akin to workers in a high-
          pressure sales force (see Endron Files), where competitors (other
          blankbodies) prey on any member showing weakness or a lapse of dil-
          igence. Self-destructive personalities seem unlikely to last long
          in such an environment, or even be accepted for membership.

                A history of faith, or,
                how we killed God to
                survive
                By Eberlin Albertzen, childe of Albertus Magnus

                Our founders were, with some notable exceptions,
                of the same Catholic faith as I was born into. In
                1494, even the truly ancient would admit that God
                was as real as any temple in Constantinople. Even
                the Cainite heretics of Languedoc were born from
                an inversion of Christian doctrine. So why did
                the Camarilla Kindred turn from Rome, and then
                from God altogether? Why did we, as an organisa-
                tion if not as individuals, abandon faith and hedge
                our bets with Lutherans and rationalists? Why did
                we have to kill God to survive? And what did we
                replace Him with? How did it happen and what
                ideas have guided our august institution after His
                demise?
                    It began as a necessity. To hide our existence
                and avoid another Inquisition, the Camarilla had
                to undermine human belief in hobgoblins, angels,
                and devils like ourselves. To neonates like you and
                anchilla like my childer, it is tempting to see our
                sect as an enlightenment project. This position ig-
                nores the fact that ideas of empiricism and natural
                rights were still centuries away when the ill-fated
                convention happened in Thorns.


                Catholics
                During the Burning Times the thought of a world
                without Christ or His Church was an impossibility.
                Whether we believed ourselves cursed or tested,
                as devils or avenging angels, we were somehow a
                part of God’s plan, and the Church was universally
                seen as an embodiment of His will on earth. We
                had placed ourselves in relation to the doctrine of
                faith for centuries, and we were unable to imag-
                ine a world without Him. So as we always do, we
                latched onto human developments. Supported by
                a correspondence between the anti-clerical and

            whom I hold responsible for ushering in the Burning              lasted almost two full centuries. You could say that as

            Human Rights, in that they are rules which all the
            members of the Camarilla have agreed to honor. But
            like the members of the UN, the Kindred interpret the
            rules differently from domain to domain. For instance,
            Article 3 of the Universal Declaration is the right to
            life, so most countries in the UN have agreed to get rid
            of capital punishment, but the US still uses that in 31
            states, with the pro-life movements arguing that the
            rule is really all about carrying pregnancies to term.
            However, besides fulfilling the role of moral guide-
            lines, the Traditions also exist to protect our contin-
            ued survival as a species. We are too different without
            some common agreements, and we would push our-                   After I kill I feel all the pressures and

            Traditions in their own way. Some Traditions leave
            little room for interpretation, others differ vastly in
            execution all over the empire. So, before you enter a
            domain, be sure you have educated yourself on their
            laws. You can expect to be punished for any transgres-           I am frozen, I cannot change. Over time I

            Despite everything, he couldn’t throw away a good meal.                     It’s an old rumor that some Kindred cannot enter a house

              Approved By: Somers, Alfred (193)
              Location: 3715 Macomb St NW, Washington, DC 20016
              Persons: WITNESS Pocklington, Andrea
                       WITNESS Carluccio, James
              Offenders: Unidentified black woman, 25 to 30 years of age, wearing a
                Washington Wizards vest top, nose piercing.
              Property: 2 Amys Italian Restaurant
              Narrative:
              3715 Macomb St NW is a popular Italian pizzeria, with no reported
                disturbances prior to this. I was approximately two hours into my
                shift, patrolling Woodley Park when the radio called in an armed
                robbery taking place at the 2 Amys Italian Restaurant. I responded
                and used my sirens.
              When I arrived at the location I requested backup immediately, as no
                other cars had responded.
              I exited my vehicle and approached the restaurant. I could see that
                it was full of standing people, but no one was moving. Suspecting
                a hostage situation, I radioed again for backup, and called the
                restaurant’s phone number to see if anyone was capable of respond-
                ing.
              As the phone rang, the people broke from their poses, some sitting
                down, others running for the door, while a waiter answered the
                phone.
              Ascertaining it wasn’t a hostage situation, I entered the restau-
                rant to be told by 12 patrons that they had no memory of the last
                30 minutes to an hour. Only two witnesses, Andrea Pocklington and
                proprietor James Carluccio, spoke about the suspect who reportedly
                held the restaurant patrons at gunpoint while they emptied their
                possessions into a bag, and then commanded them to forget what had
                just taken place.
              Witness Andrea Pocklington professes fear of meeting this “hypnotist”
                again while James Carluccio has volunteered with a detailed wit-
                ness account. Recommend detectives call upon him tomorrow to get
                more information.

                break the Masquerade.
                    Instead of working against the Masquerade you                   I hope you can see how this tactic is so beneficial.
                must use it to your advantage. First, it is imperative              Whether you control the chief cashier in a casino, the
                you find a mortal useful and trustworthy enough to                  capo of a mafia crew, or a doctor at the blood bank,
                risk showing them a little of your hand. You cannot
                use your circumstances to openly manipulate an entire
                organization, but you can pull the strings of select
                individuals. To make the Masquerade work in your
                favor, you’ll need to divulge a little of your nature.
                    Here are my suggestions:
                ■ Find out what your prospective target wants and
                    needs. Come to them as a friend and benefactor.
                ■ Confess a little of your power. Focus on the aspects
                    that are only a little beyond what is normal:
                    improved mental and physical capacities, a longer
                    life, a resistance to illness. Whatever their need,
                    underline the aspect that would solve it. Do not
                    mention the downsides.
                ■ They’ll want to know more. Tell them you can get
                    them the same abilities. Ask for nothing in return
                    at this point.

                    I’ve been secretly commis-

                so-called Gehenna War by Justicar

                resources to see what’s happening
                on the ground. I’ll collect these
                findings in this diary and use it to
                compose my final report.
                    Before I get to work, it’s time
                for the Parisian Success Story to
                make his grand homecoming.

                15.7.2017 - baghdad
                I saw my mother, my father, my
                cousins and so many more people
                last night, for the first time in
                many, many years. They all seemed
                so old, worn down. My powers as
                a Kindred hid my true nature from
                them, as I played with their emo-
                tions and their memories to accept
                me as I was, despite the years that
                had passed.
                    One of my cousins took me to
                see the rubble of our old house,
                where we lived before it was
                shattered by an American rocket.
                A neighbor came to talk to us, a
                man I vaguely remembered from
                my childhood. He reminded me
                that my father had been a com-
                munist. When I was young, I stole
                his books, seduced by this forbid-
                den lore. I guess some things even
                death doesn’t change.
                    But perhaps it’s better to focus
                on the task at hand.
                    This war is a conflict between
                the Sabbat and the Camarilla, it is

                It took only a few minutes, and the Ashirra were
            eager to show me the results.
                I’d never seen a Sabbat hideout in my life. I’d heard
            horror stories, but they don’t really prepare you. The
            important thing to understand is that the Sabbat
            doesn’t care about the Masquerade or the long-term.
            They took over the base because they wanted to use it
            for a week or two, no more. They’d be long gone after
            that, leaving blood addicts and deranged fledglings in
            their wake.
                As I explored the building, I found bodies lying in
            the basement, Iraqi men, women and children, some
            drained of blood and others not. The soldiers were
            filthy, as if they’d forgotten how to take care of them-
            selves. Some of them had old gunshot wounds that had
            gone untreated. I saw passages from the heretical Book
            of Nod scrawled on the walls and chalices grimed with
            the mixed blood of Kindred, the forced group blood
            bond that is the Sabbat’s hallmark.
                Fatima was not the first bad thing to happen to
            these people. The Sabbat had destroyed their minds
            and spirits. Who or what exactly were we fighting
            here?
                The question made me suddenly aware of the
            Ashirra around me and I had to get outside and away
            from the tight passageways. I found Fatima leaning
            against the door of a humvee, fiddling with her phone
            again with the difficulty of the aged. She looked up at
            me and said: “The mortals are so inventive. This is a
            wonderful little toy.”
                For a second, the genuine delight in her face made
            her look human again.
                Saida was waiting for me with a car and a driver.
            “How are you going to explain all these dead soldiers?”
            I asked her, sounding shrill even to my own ears. I’ve
            seen war but never something like this.
                “You have your own agents with the Americans
            and Iraqis, don’t you?” Saida asked in a sibilant whis-
            per. “We’re partners in this. We take out the Sabbat,
            you do the cleanup.”
                The Malkavian’s message was clear, and the
            shrewdness of her clan shone through from behind
            her wild eyes. The Camarilla might come here as their
            allies, but this was Ashirra territory and this was their
            war. If we forgot that, they would bring out the needle.

                around me.                                                       the flight.
                    It didn’t look good.                                             We drove for hours into the desert, swerving
                    Then Fatima appeared out of nowhere and tack-                between the eroding craters created by decades of
                led me off the roof.                                             fighting. Finally, we came to a ruin that was eroded
                    We spent two nights hiding in the slums in a                 by time but untouched by war, and Fatima told me to
                shack the size of a garden shed. Sometimes the local             stop. I’d left my assistants and bodyguards behind, so
                kine checked in on us and Fatima gave them money.                it was just the two of us.
                She was surprisingly kind.                                           Fatima offered me a shovel and told me where to
                                                                                 dig. She waited by the car trying to get reception on her

                This mission is driving me insane. I thought the hard            slab hidden under the sand. She stopped me and lifted

                city I escaped with considerable effort before my                hole leading underground. Once we had descended the
                embrace. Or maybe seeing all the suffering caused by             stairs, I started to grasp the enormity of the under-
                war, dictators, the endless supply of Western weap-              ground structure we were entering. The writing on the
                ons, climate change, American drone attacks and all              walls was indecipherable to me, pictograms of mysteri-
                the other evils drowning this region in blood. But the           ous rites an archeologist would give their very life to see.
                hardest part has been having to sit in these air-condi-              As Fatima walked beside me, something in her
                tioned rooms listening to the supposedly wise leaders            changed. I realized that before this moment I’d only

                    We’re not secret benefactors. We’re monsters, and I              “I can’t come any further” Fatima said in a hollow
                fear there are worst monsters still quietly twisting even        voice bereft of all compassion, “You must go the rest of
                these elders into the shapes that suit their purposes.           the way alone.”
                    I met Fatima al-Faqadi again and she spoke to me
                about some of the tombs at the center of this war and            31.10.2017 - venice

                                                 second
                                           inquisition
                    I realize we didn’t actually spend much time together even as I Embraced you and brought you into the
                    Camarilla. You don’t know me beyond what I did to you and from these little notes I have left you. Maybe
                    you think me a flippant monster toying with matters of life and death.
                        Well, when it comes to the Second Inquisition, I am not playing games. They are terrifying and you must
                    take them seriously. Otherwise, you really will die.
                        I want you to appreciate these words. I have lost many dear friends to the Inquisition and almost died
                    myself. Sometimes we forget the advantage the Masquerade gives us over the mortals. We forget how weak
                    they are made by their ignorance. Once they learn the truth, they are not so weak.
                        I do not like to talk about this, but I made it out of London when the Second Inquisition started its assault. I
                    was in the haven of a friend when the doors were bashed in. There was sunlight everywhere, my friend col-
                    lapsing into dust as he tried to claw his way to safety. I was burned badly, and from my wounds they could
                    easily tell what I was. Embarrassingly, I was saved only by my speed and knowledge of the London sewer
                    network. I used to live there, at one point, and the sewers have a lot of history.
                        After sundown, I made my way to the airport with a view to borrowing Lady Anne's private jet, but they
                    had seized that too. The same happened to me at countless other havens. All destroyed or full of terrifying
                    kine. I soon realized it was even difficult to walk the streets, the damnable cameras the mortals put everywhere
                    detecting me when I tried.
                        I had to fall back to my oldest tricks. I pretended to be an illegal Russian immigrant on the run from the
                    authorities, and a sweet young man drove me out of the city in the trunk of his car. I was so overcome with
                    gratitude, I gave him a ring I'd had in my possession for two centuries.
                        The Second Inquisition killed the high and mighty of London Kindred society. They made Victoria Ash
                    run like a dog. If you have a burning desire to fight them, fight like a vampire. Unfairly, and from far away.

            Society of St. Leopold
            The true core of the Catholic Inquisition, the So-
            ciety of Leopold — or St. Leopold — has hunted us
            continually since its foundation in 1231 by Leopold
            of Murnau and Pope Gregory IX. Its fortunes waxed
            and waned with our own carelessness: the increasing
            effectiveness of the Masquerade eventually con-
            vinced even the Church that the Leopoldite crusad-
            ers were superstitious mad men. By the twentieth
            century, the Vatican had severed its formal ties
            of patronage and support, moving its clandestine
            energies entirely into its centuries-old intelligence
            organ, the Holy Alliance (known as the Entity since
            1930). Denied the cloak of faith and patronage,
            the society was well on its way to disintegration
            through backbiting and factionalization. With the
            escalating reckless piercings of the Masquerade,
            however, it returned in force.
                An Austrian fanatic named Ingrid Bauer, the
            so-called “Iron Maiden,” ascended as Grand Inquisi-
            tor in 1998 and began a full-fledged crusade against
            our kind. Even before the American military got
            into the inquisition business, Bauer’s Gladius Dei

   CAMARILLA




                 The Elysium is your place to shine. Your battlefield, the stage for your greatest joys and most mordant sorrows. You
                 will be trashed and humiliated, driven out in tears. You will engage in stratagems so subtle your enemies will never
                 realize you were behind their misfortunes.
                      For me, Elysium has always been the heart of the Camarilla. My most natural environment.
                      There's an aspect to Elysium I've always found highly amusing. In most cities, Elysia are free from violence. We
                 are not allowed to physically assault each other, or sometimes even use the powers of our Blood. A wise restriction,
                 to be sure. But does it make Elysium into a peaceful place, a venue for diplomacy and reaching common ground? I
                 think not. The restrictions on obvious harm only mean that we can put into play much more grievous plots.
                      I trust you are starting to understand why I love it so!
                      Whatever you plan, it cannot be obvious. If you wish to harm someone, do not go directly against them. Instead,
                 target their assets, friends, loved ones, mortal relatives. Then, offer to make peace with them and help them against
                 this mysterious assailant. Frame another enemy for the deed, or better yet, one of your allies, just to make the plot
                 harder to penetrate. If you execute a move like this properly, you'll find yourself holding the hand of your enemy as
                 he cries about the family he has lost.
                      Sometimes I leave it at that.
                      Conventional wisdom of Elysium says that you attack the powerful for profit and the weak for fun. Many do this,
                 and seem to enjoy themselves, so I won't say it's not something you should do. Personally, I have always found it
                 unsporting to destroy the vulnerable. It is too easy, and I like a challenge. There's a real thrill in humiliating someone
                 much more powerful than you are and escaping any consequences.
                      The mightiest of the Kindred style themselves ancient and wise, but most are still perfectly susceptible to com-
                 mon flattery. They have egos like the rest of us, and if they think themselves immune to manipulation, they are even
                 easier prey. Still, consider sometimes taking the risk of being contrary. For most elders, having anyone speak against
                 them is a rare occurrence. They surround themselves with sycophants who hang at their every word, so they may
                 find a young rebel exciting. Of course, this can also get you killed.
                      To really convince people of your sincerity, you must act with your heart before you betray them. Let's imagine
                 that a rival has destroyed your chances of fulfilling your dream of becoming the Keeper of the Elysium. Can you go
                 up to them, flirt, apologize for your presumptuousness, and confess you have always admired them? Can you look
                 them deep in the eyes, tell them you love them, and mean it?
                      A word of warning about these kinds of emotionally charged revenge plots: If you want to be believable, you
                 have to allow yourself to feel. If you do so, you may find your original objectives changing. This has happened to me
                 countless times. I remember once when a young neonate, a slip of a girl, seduced a lover I was cultivating at the time.
                 I was furious. No child is going to get the better of me! I went to her, spoke very sweetly, and before I realized what
                 was happening, I was having an affair with her. I stopped caring about my original plan for revenge because I was
                 enjoying myself too much.
                      Why do so many Kindred seem superficial, obsessed with appearances to an embarrassing degree? The answer
                 is simple: For protection. If your peers think you mainly care about sporting a fresh new style every season at the
                 Elysium, they won't find out about your mortal lover, your secret childe, or your commitment to the Catholic faith.
                 Every time the people at Elysium find out you care about something, you have a new weakness. They will know
                 where to strike.
                      The trick is to show only what you want them to see.

            There’s still too many shadows               Strong, and in many ways, in-
            here, too much flesh, too many           credibly repressive. Paris is a bad
            drugs, too much needless blood-          place to be if you are Anarch,           Our city is the most important
            shed… I get away from myself.            clanless, or even a Camarilla            battleground in Europe tonight.
                 It is difficult to rattle me,       Kindred without good references.         Too many eyes focus west on
            but Miami does it. The mortals           Prince François Villon has ruled         the void that is London or the

            loses something. Their compassion,       hands all over French court, liv-        is something more. Made symbolic

                                                   you can never be boring. Be flighty, temperamental, passionate.

                The Ventrue in Kindred Society
                   <LuJu added FSav0>
                   LuJu: Subtle chat, got it?
                   FSav0: As crystal.
                   Jackson: Good. We don't need any more shit raining down on the city.
                   LuJu: Excellent. We need to discuss our role in the society.
                   Jackson: We remain on top. As always.
                   LuJu: We would like to think that, but with the recent defections to
                     and from our country club, our position is precarious.
                   FSav0: While I agree we’ve now got rivals to our seats from the Sau-
                     di, nobody trusts them. We’re a known quantity. We have ever swum
                     in the seas of influence. Sometimes we manipulate it from behind
                     the throne, while at other times we take the crown and scepter.
                     Whenever there are reins of power, we have at least one hand placed
                     firmly on the strap. Ever since we crushed the B in C’thage, we’ve
                     been in charge. Everyone knows this.
                   Jackson: We're considered to have the wealthiest individual members,
                     though obviously we're a society of self-interested, motivated in-
                     dividuals. We're not into lending resources to each other, but we
                     buy influence, we silence opponents, hire help, and live out our
                     opulent existences from our penthouse suites and private jets.
                   LuJu: We need to consider if that opulence is a risk. We stand strong
                     as the country club’s figurehead and we do this by identifying to-
                     day’s trends and emulating them to great success. The question has
                     to be whether this puts a target on our foreheads.
                   LuJu: We’re at the front of the club.
                   Jackson: It is what it is. At least we're doing better than our Vien-
                     nese friends or the dancing trash.
                   FSav0: Agreed. We’re at the front of the club because we’re the only
                     ones who can handle it. We don’t ask for power. It is our duty.
                   LuJu: So you two maintain that despite recent events, our position
                     remains unchanged? Still kings, still duty-bound to rule, still go-
                     ing to be recognized as the country club’s poster kids?
                   Jackson: I'll take that any day over Anarch ignominy.
                   FSav0: Fuck, that’s a damn buzzword. Log off. Get away from your cur-
                     rent location. Now.

                                                least once. There's something so touching about how grateful
                                                and sincere they are. They look at you like at a gift from God.

   CAMARILLA




                The Nosferatu
                in Kindred Society
                This is Ambrus. If you can stand to listen to this
                recording without destroying the machine it’s playing
                from, let me tell you how I sorry I am that it came to
                this, but let me also tell you why we did what we did.
                     Necessity forces action. We joined the Cama-
                rilla because the benefit of being able to hide from
                humanity was greater than the allure to rule it. We’re
                a grounded clan, so far as it goes, in touch with those
                who struggle against great odds, even if we prey on
                them regularly. We’ve always been better at hiding
                than seeking.
                     So as the Camarilla started tightening its noose
                around Kindred who weren’t 100% bona fide Camaril-
                la, you expected us to inflate the life raft for both our
                clans, for when we jumped overboard. We even told
                you we would. We told you that the Camarilla would
                do nothing but subjugate our clan at a time the sect
                was under more scrutiny than it had ever been. We
                said the Anarchs were the best fit for us.
                     I hate to tell you this, but we lied our asses off. We
                let you jump, and even gave you a little push, but we
                never had any intention of joining you. We saw the
                Brujah following the Gangrel and realized the Cama-                    spectacular masks designed to hide their form, while others

                This will shock you, but until now, I have never had a Haqimite lover. In a few cases a Child of Haqim
                has tried to pursue me romantically. Stern, serious young men, and once a woman too. The tragedy
                was that sometimes it's more pleasant to be wanted than to give in. With these individuals, I sensed
                their devotion and need, the intensity of their emotions. There was something pleasurable in their frus-
                trations, and it would have passed if I had accepted them.
                    In time, they get over it.
                    Word of warning, though. It's fun to pit suitors against each other. Their jealousy of one another is
                entertaining to watch, often good for a laugh at the Elysium. However, and I speak from experience, it
                can be dangerous if one of them is a Haqimite. The woman who pursued me challenged my lover to a
                duel and killed him. An altogether romantic display of ardor, but unfortunately she was sentenced to see
                the sun by a Prince who did not understand the finer points of violent love.
                    My future husband will be a Haqimite, so I will finally complete my set.
                    Young that you are, you probably want to ask why I'm going along with this. The great alliance be-
                tween the Camarilla and the Ashirra will be made official though this wedding, with me as the symbolic
                offering. Why accept such a role for myself?
                    You must understand that we exist for a very long time. Many things can happen. I have resolved
                to be the main character in my own story, and with this step, I move from being a mid-level Camarilla
                celebrity to the center stage. It requires me to take a certain role, but it also propels me upwards.
                    For a mortal, a choice like this would define the rest of their life. This would be their final fate.
                    For an immortal... Well, I do not wish to disrespect my future husband. I will cherish him for the
                rest of eternity. After all, what kind of a person would act dishonestly at their own wedding?

                is so. Most of our warrior caste cling to Alamut and
                the old ways. But the Old Man of the Mountain is
                dead and the assassins now worship the blood god
                Ur-Shulgi and have revived the archaic ways of blood
                worship. This is the code that tells them to slay and
                consume the souls of all vampires outside our blood-
                line. The rest of us refuse to give up our mortal faith
                and morality. We recognized long ago the danger of
                slavish service to an inhuman being and found purpose
                in the infinite scope of Allah’s mercy. Ours is a code of
                killing for peace and the greater good.
                    Fleeing alongside our kine, escaping the madness
                of the Gehenna War, we risk everything to find new
                homes. We beseech the Camarilla for sanctuary, and
                for the most part they grant it. We are grateful to
                them for their respect. In this they are much better
                than the increasingly Islamophobic kine of the West.
                We pray they will not turn back to the intolerance we
                have come to expect from European and American
                elders. Perhaps the opposite is true. This union of ours
                can be the first step towards an age of understanding
                and justice for both the living and the dead.


                We are the judges of all. We must deliver sometimes unpal-
                atable sentences to our fellow Kindred. It is a role for which
                we are feared and respected, and one of which I am proud.
                A daughter of Haqim, I serve my kind as an instrument of
                justice. As a creation of Allah, I feel remorse for every slice
                of the blade, every scorch of flame, and I question every
                ounce of satisfaction that comes with ending the lives of the
                unworthy. The Prophet’s are words of peace and community.
                I am cursed to lead a life of war to make them manifest.
                Such is my role, and who am I to question it?

                THE ANARCH CLANS
                The Camarilla has many enemies. Perhaps the most tragic of them is the Anarchs who imagine they can
                survive outside the protective reach of our great project. When I think of their chances for survival and
                experiencing the true blessings of immortality, I almost weep.
                     The Camarilla has withdrawn behind our natural borders, so to speak. We do not pretend to represent
                every mangy little blood sucker anymore; we have come to demand a certain level of refinement from
                our members. But while ridding ourselves of the Gangrel was only reasonable, I must admit that it has
                made our Elysiums slightly too proper.
                     There is a little game you can play if you get tired of the endless politics of court. It requires a modi-
                cum of modesty and an ability to give up center stage, but I assure you it is worth it.
                     Many vampires know my name, but few actually know what I look like. It is easy for me to reinvent
                myself, and it will be even easier for you.
                     This is what I do: I invent a new identity, a backstory and style. The last time I did this, I was Jasmin
                de Lacy, a poor little rich girl who had fallen into the clutches of an evil Toreador elder and only barely
                escaped an addiction to his Blood, only to find herself alone and vulnerable on the streets.
                     Jasmin was a great success. The Anarchs were averse to my upper class background at first, but start-
                ed to warm up to me after I told them many horror stories about the vile things going on at the Elysium. I
                cried tears of Blood, as I did my bravura reenactment of how the elder had bound my mortal parents to his
                vitae and forced me to witness their addicted degradation.
                     The key to success with this kind of a ploy is to avoid making yourself the center of attention at all
                times. I know the temptation to be real, because it's so easy. However, the more people pay attention, the
                greater the risk of failure.
                     With Jasmin, I settled into the role of a girl the rebels had heroically rescued from the evil sect which
                would control her. I went to their parties, played around with their mortal friends and followers, had a
                bunch of affairs and just generally got back in touch with humanity again. It was lovely. They were so
                young and so earnest. Every moment with them gave me more will to go on existing.
                     You are thinking this story will end with some grand betrayal where I called in the Archons to bring
                fire and fury to these young upstarts.
                     It does not.
                     I left after the wedding plans started to take up most of my time. As far as those Anarchs know, Jasmin
                de Lacy is still out there, a hapless little unbound creature fleeing the wrath of her vicious sire.

            that had been working. They danced in our ancestors’

   CAMARILLA




                                          CLAN GANGREL
                            A pretty useless clan, romantically speaking.
                                I know that some Toreador like to romanticize the Gangrel as authentic savages who are
                            somehow more honest and real than the rest of us. But I don’t buy it. There's nothing as fake
                            as authenticity. The filthy, matted hair of a Savage is just another surface, their pretense at
                            not caring about appearances merely a pose.
                                This is embarrassing to admit, but I fell for the whole Gangrel mystique once when I was
                            much younger. I had just arrived in America for the first time. He was tall, rugged, handsome
                            in a bestial way. He did not talk much, and I imagined his silence hid a rich inner life.
                                I even lived in a rural cabin with him for half a year, drinking the blood of animals. Can
                            you imagine? Me, as a homesteader?
                                It took me a long time to understand that the fantasy I'd fallen in love with was my own
                            creation. I had just projected an idea on to a man who was not much more than a beast.
                                Do you wish to know the silliest part? When I tried to leave him, he cried. He pleaded,
                            and tried to stop me. I was terrified for a second because he had always seemed so much
                            stronger than me. I thought he would kill me in his jealous weakness.

   CAMARILLA




                                               CLAN BRUJAH
                            The Brujah like to see themselves as philosophers and revolutionaries, but personally I think their
                            main utility comes in when you want a good hard, angry-at-the-establishment fuck. I mean, who
                            would ever want to have a relationship with a Punk? A Rebel lover? The idea is ridiculous. They
                            lose their temper at the slightest provocation, and the rest of the time they will surely be lecturing
                            you on something terribly uninteresting.
                                 Ideally, try to avoid talking to them at all.
                                 Normally, I like a good, long seduction. I like it when someone exciting and new pursues me,
                            and tries to win my favour. I also enjoy seducing so-called impossible targets, those others tell me
                            will never be interested. It is a tantalizing game, and it makes the success so much more delicious.
                                 None of that applies to the Punks. Here it is best to be direct, to be physical right from the
                            first glance at one another. Lay your hands on their chest, let them feel how you tremble a little
                            so close to them, and make sure to accidentally bare your neck or open your lips (depending on
                            whether you want to lead or be led). Let nature do the rest. If your desired rebel still talks at this
                            point, perhaps they are not worth it, after all.

   CAMARILLA




                                               THE SABBAT
                        As you may have gathered from my writing, I treasure feeling and sensation above all things.
                        New emotions and fresh experiences have filled me with a desire to meet the next night and the
                        next, burning through more centuries than I care to admit in a flurry of passionate affairs and
                        vendettas. I am made of jealousy, lust, greed, and hate. I exist in a state of constant desire. Even
                        a wicked breed of love has played its part in making this dead heart beat for centuries. Predict-
                        able feelings in a Rose, yes? How about fear? Terror? Revulsion? For the most part unlife in the
                        Camarilla holds no such thing for me. Even cold elders with nightmare stratagems play a game I
                        recognize. They maintain human, if antiquated, facades as they ply their nightmare schemes. Po-
                        lite monstrosity I can deal with. But there are dead things that scare me. Things that have scarred
                        me. Things I never want to have to think about again. While this compendium concerns our order
                        of the bedchamber, I must include a warning here.
                             You may seek the razor’s edge to feel alive, this I can understand. Just never, ever deal with
                        the Hand. When the Sabbat comes for you, you fight or you run. Do not make my mistake and try
                        to humanize or understand them. There is nothing but hopeless emptiness waiting for you if you
                        try.
                             Have you ever met someone about to be swallowed by the Beast? Looked into the dead eyes of
                        a wight in the making. If you have, you have surely felt it. The revulsion rising from the realisation
                        that this inhuman thing could be you if you just gave in to the hunger. We recoil from the edge,
                        cling to memories of hot life to keep it at bay.
                             The Sabbat are frightening because they look back at us with these same inhuman eyes, but
                        they do so with full cognition. Here are dead drones of the Beast, yet they are gifted with a collec-
                        tive intelligence disguised as faith and purpose.
                             Some think the Sabbat weaker or less dangerous now that they have (seemingly) given up on
                        controlling the cities of America and flocked to the war zones of the world, supposedly to revel
                        freely in their vampiric nature under the cover of systematic bombings, atrocities, and the chaos
                        of human warfare. I’m sure they do, but that is not their purpose. These revenants, hardly Kindred
                        at all, seek to transcend what it means to be human. They want to consume the eldest and wisest
                        of us and infect all our species with their loss of self. This Gehenna war is not the end of them, it
                        is another stage. It’s a chrysalis. War is changing the Sabbat from the inside and out, and I dread
                        what they will become, twisted and scarred by the fires of their victory. I hate to be serious now,
                        but you should know, whatever official reports are saying about the Gehenna war, we are not win-
                        ning it.
                             I feel an itch under my eye. There is still a dark spot there in the shape of a snake eating its
                        own tail, barely visible, where my Sabbat lover touched me. I’ve made up my mind. That touch
                        was the last. If ever another soulless blood-drone of the Black Hand reaches out to touch me
                        again, I will rather end this eternity than let it. I suggest you take the same approach and steel
                        yourself for what, in a few short years, will come crawling out of Jerusalem and back into our
                        nights.

                          In most things, I believe knowledge is power. In the case of the Sabbat, I say the less you know
                      about the nihilist Magisters and the flesh-melting Fiends of the Lasombra and the Tzimisce, the
                      better. I will leave only fragments here. Use them to avoid the corrupted clans. Never think you
                      can ally with, reason, or even parley with the Sabbat. You may think me emotional — some of
                      them can seem quite reasonable. At first. But they are not just another sect or gathering of clans.
                      They are infected by a virus, a sickness, a conscious disease. You won’t find an essay about the
                      clans of the Sabbat here, and now you know my reasons. Understanding brings danger. I don’t
                      love you, but I never want you to feel the fear I did during those endless hot nights in an Atlanta
                      trainyard, reduced to screaming flesh in the claws of the Black Hand.

   CAMARILLA




                    Most Sabbat domains are still out-of-bounds to
                the Camarilla, unless you are Fiorenza Savona of Clan
                Ventrue, who swiftly brought Mexico City under
                control. But most are empty or emptying as the Sabbat
                packs after, riddled with blood madness, gather by the
                greatest source of vitae in the world: the Middle East.
                My home, where methuselahs rise and destroy all these
                foolish Sabbat who run up to take a bite from them.
                    Do I diminish their actions? Possibly. The sect
                makes a frightening sight when one meets them, but
                give me a legion of armored, drilled, and loyal soldiers
                over a ravenous horde of Sabbat baboons any night.
                They terrorize, they butcher, they draw the Inquisition
                wherever they tread. But we stand tall.
                    Let the Sabbat consume itself in an orgy of vio-
                lence. We have paid for the good seats.


                Strip lights lining the corridor ceiling flickered to life as
                Big D hit the switch. “See, this place isn’t so bad. We can
                host our rave here, no problems.” She peered into one of the
                sealed off wards. “They’ve even got trolleys and what looks
                like medical equipment still stowed away in here. Were they
                thinking of coming back someday, do you think?”
                     Ark shook his head, only half-listening. The idea of host-
                ing a party in an abandoned hospital was pretty predict-
                able, but he couldn’t deny the location’s aesthetic appeal.
                Something didn’t smell right, though. It was understandable
                that D, being so thin of blood, wouldn’t pick up on it, but he
                was older and had certain gifts for this kind of thing. There
                was vitae and death here, and not that long ago.
                     “Hey, Ark! Look! Some of the wards down here don’t
                have chains on them. Maybe we can-” the young one’s
                voice was cut off as she stepped back from the door she was
                pushing open. “What in the ever living f-” she never finished
                her sentence as something not quite arms, legs, and fingers
                pushed through the swinging doors, disappearing as quickly
                with her thrashing form. Ark didn’t waste time, but bound-
                ed backwards as fast as he could toward the staircase. He
                was stopped, as a long taloned hand grabbed his shoulder
                and teased bone through skin.
                     “Going somewhere, little Anarch? Come, come. If you
                must trespass, you should at least stay for dinner.”
                     Ark and Big D were never seen again. Not the way
                people remembered them, anyhow ■

                        mbraced in the 12th century C.E., Fatima al-Faqadi is
                        ancient among tonight’s active Kindred. Known within
                        the Children of Haqim as the Hand of Vengeance, she is
                        one of the most dangerous and skilled assassins who have
            ever been among the Kindred.
                Fatima is a faithful Muslim and a sworn enemy of the blood
            cultists of Ur-Shulgi. She once worked for vitae, undertaking
            contracts for Blood funneled back physically or by sorcerous rituals
            to her clan’s fortress, Alamut. But these nights, Alamut is under
            Ur-Shulgi’s control, and Fatima is reported to be the leader of a
            charge of Banu Haqim fighting side by side with the Camarilla in
            the Gehenna war.
                Evil tongues would have it she is in the fight only to find out
            what happened to her once-lover and rival, Lucita. For her part,
            Fatima silences such rumors with a stare almost as deadly as her
            knives.

                      ome vampires claim the status of deities among
                      both Kindred and kine. Next to Set, Mithras is
                      likely the most infamous of the god-Cainites. A
                      Ventrue of incredible age and power, and one of
            the longest standing Princes in Kindred history, Mithras
            formed a cult of faithful adherents to the Mithraic religion,
            incorporating trappings from the legitimate religion of old
            and ancient vampiric traditions.
                Though Mithras was destroyed in the 20th century, and
            his diablerist in turn reportedly destroyed in the Second
            Inquisition’s purge of London, his long-time seneschal and

                              Embraced in the 17th century C.E. when she was still known as
                          Victorine de Perpignan, she came from poverty, worked as a camp
            follower for the French army, and drew little regard but for her beauty and stun-

            diplomacy, etiquette, and strategy, Embracing her for them and for the reasons
            the mortal soldiers adored her so.
                Combined with the devotion Victoria draws from Kindred due to her cha-

            Justicars of the Camarilla to seal the Vermilion Wedding agreement with Tegyrius
            of the Ashirra.

   CAMARILLA




                         Dear Childe,

                         I hope you have found this collection of disparate perspectives into the Camarilla
                         somewhat useful. This is a cold, impersonal way to enter the Camarilla, but I’ve come
                         to think it's for the best. When I was Embraced a long time ago, my Sire told me beau-
                         tiful things about eternal love, beauty, and immortality. He was a man who wanted
                         very much to be adored by pretty young girls, and knowing no better, I adored him.
                              Nothing he told me was of any use in the Camarilla. He gave me the love story so
                         many yearn for when they think about our kind, but the only thing that allowed me to
                         navigate the dangers of the Elysium were my wits. I learn fast and you must learn too.
                              I say without exaggeration that my wedding will change the course of the Cama-
                         rilla. This will affect you as well. The hopeful and the desperate will ask you for
                         favors, imagining that you can help connect them with me. If you wish, you can use
                         this to your advantage. If you use my name to play politics with enough style, I won't
                         mind.
                              Still, I do not wish you to become a wastrel. I have spent a lot of time trying to
                         avoid it, but the temptation is there. The identity of your Sire can make things seem-
                         ingly easy for you, but that road will not take you very far. You can live among the
                         other childer of Camarilla luminaries, wallowing in luxury, and in ten or twenty
                         years you will die in some kind of an embarrassing, ridiculous incident.
                              Build your own empire. Use the resources I have left you. It will be a harder road,
                         but it is the one you can walk for as long as you like. That's what immortality is.

                            Your loving Sire,
