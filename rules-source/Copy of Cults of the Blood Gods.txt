                This book concerns vampires’ relationship to religion. It features harmful and twisted alternate interpretations of reli-
                gious practice, just as vampires are in many ways alternate versions of mortal life. Many of the depictions of religion
                within this text show the worst aspects of religious devotion. Please remember not to confuse the vampiric version of
                a religion with its real-life counterparts. If you learn something new about someone else’s religious traditions through
                this book, that’s great, but before you do anything with that info, always check with real-world sources to make sure
                it’s not a fictional in-game only detail.

                    what do we do about these new faiths
                                                           rising up?

                   some of you feel it as well?

                   Lucinde: It is hard to deny the power
                                                           of old blood. I can see how often
                   they become objects of worship.
                  Ian Carfax: You sound like you might
                                                          know something about that.

                  do we stem this tide so we can deal with
                                                             all of our other� challenges? We

                 deny the existence of ancient ones, how
                                                             can we now? But we will not sup-
                 port the idea either.
                 Ian Carfax: Explain.
                 Diana Iadanza: Can you not see it? We
                                                         would run ourselves ragged trying
                 to “stem this tide,” as you say. But we
                                                          will do as we have always done.

            The Lord of the Red Desert
                   From the collected teachings of Wise Neferneferu to their pupil Ahmose

                   Neferneferu: We have many desert flowers to choose from this year. Perhaps we
                   can finally find you a sister.
                   Ahmose: Thank you, sire, I would welcome a sibling. I too noticed an upward
                   trend of acolytes. What do you think caused it?
                   Neferneferu: The time of the Tyrant Priest of Rome draws to an end. People are
                   returning to the gods of old. Our Lord included.
                   Ahmose: True. Do you think it will last?
                   Neferneferu: Nothing lasts. Even in the Old Kingdom, our Lord waxed and waned
                   in popularity. But this does not matter � He is true, and people always return
                   to truth eventually.
                   Ahmose: Why now though? Do you think it ties into the rumored awakening of
                   the ancients?
                   Neferneferu: For the children of the Storm Father, certainly. The ancients
                   proved themselves real, and our Lord at least rewards His faithful. We are
                   servants in His army, soldiers and generals alike, rather than lambs to sate
                   an ancient’s appetite. Many children of the Aeons seek to abandon their false
                   and tyrannical masters, in favor of our Lord’s magnanimity.
                   Ahmose: And kine? Why so many new adherents among them?
                   Neferneferu: A congruence of events. The stranglehold of Rome finally abates,

                     I’m feeling confused, and... upset, and angry, maybe betrayed, not sure yet. These self-
                actualization classes have been getting pretty weird, and some of it is good weird, but I have questions
                I’m afraid to ask there. When Taylor started telling me about Lilith, the ways I could live my life
                without fear or shame, that sounded cool. But the longer we talk, the more I’ve been digging. Lilith,
                the sexytimes demoness who kills children and fucks men for their “seed” and queen of evil shit, she’s
                not from antiquity. I mean. She, Lilith, the Dark Mother, Queen of Night, what we know her
                as is... new. The first time it’s explicitly stated she’s the first wife of Adam, that she’s got freaky
                powers and left the Garden and etc. etc. etc. is this misogynist satirist’s book (that praised scriptural
                heroes for evils that never happened!) written sometime during the Geonic period. Maybe. There are
                even multiple versions that managed to limp to the present day, and I’m not sold on their accepted
                state as one large body of work. And then it’s off to the races, with somebody, everybody and their
                mother (ha) making new stories about Lilith, casting her as cosmic evil, people making amulets to
                protect new mothers and infants from her left, right and center. Men are supposed to pray before sex
                with their wives to save themselves from the “liliths.”
                     Point is, she’s not from scripture, everyone who says she is, is making a point of extreme
                conjecture, and in some stories she’s been replaced by a different demon, or a bad angel, but then another
                version says it was her. Taylor has been teaching me pieces of the word of Lilith, but it sounds like it
                was written by a man. She says there’s nerds like me out there among the other followers, but if they
                have seen what I saw in my research, are they still followers of the Dark Mother?

                   Men cast her as a symbol of evil. And Taylor says she is evil, in her way, but that it’s okay.
              And honestly, like, I’m not sure if I necessarily care if she’s evil or not. But I want to know. I
              want some fucking answers. If we’re following something so old and powerful that it transcends our
              understanding and presumably hasn’ t been seen by her followers, her children since... a long, long time ago,
              Taylor hasn’ t taught me those sorts of verses yet, not more than a few lines.
                   If nobody knows where she is, and they buy a version of her word that sounds like it was based
              on the words of men who cannot give two shits about a woman, and all the stories are much newer than
              antiquity and say she can be bound, or at least sent away, and none of them agree about where she
              is and what’s she’s doing... what is her word? Her real word? Her true name and purpose? Because
              whoever her enemies are (and I can piece together that a mainstream deity is up there), do we really
              know the whole story? Do they believe she can be sent away with the names of angels? Because
              if that sort of object or power is in the world, wouldn’ t her enemies chase it? Seek to lure her out?
              Shouldn’ t her followers know either way? Does someone protect her interests, or is everyone too busy
              having sex in the back of a bookstore and cutting each other up and... that’s it? I know Taylor says
              there’s “greater mysteries” and they’ve got a system, clearly, of when someone is ready, just...
                   If I’m going to die for an ancient Goddess, I want to know the people next to me in the
              metaphorical pew have my back and an equal investment in the truth behind our mother. I know
              when Taylor gets off shift, and I also know that you’re not supposed to fear death if you worship the
              Dark Mother. I have a gun. I will get answers. And if those answers say try again somewhere else,
              I’ll do that.
                   May the Garden be watered with blood. I will grow her a damn grove of manchineel if I have to

                CHURCH OF SET CONVICTIONS
                While ultimately, doctrine is less important to the Church of Set than ritual and experience, neither of those will be of
                much use to an initiate who has no idea why she is doing what a priest commanded her to do. That said, the Church
                follows closely the idea of secret knowledge: that certain authorities possess divine dispensation to withhold truths
                from followers who are unready to receive them. An initiate is meant to receive the lessons on her body and soul
                first, as guided by someone well-versed in the mysteries, before she is permitted to study the texts of a temple library.
                The Church of Set finds the idea of commandments distasteful, but for those who require an easily-memorized litany
                of convictions, the doctrine of the orthodox Church commonly manifests as the following Convictions:
                • Always strive to liberate others of their vices
                Vice is a tool, not a recreation. The faithful initiate can best serve Set by winnowing the souls of the world — that is,
                separating the wheat from the chaff — by determining who is prone to degradation and who is strong enough to
                resist. What can be liberated, will be liberated, and what remains will be a legion of refined souls in service to Set,
                freed from their bondage to literally anyone and anything else. You are the thresher, not the threshed.
                • Never refuse aid to another member of the Church
                The Church of Set claims that when they rule this world, or move on to the next, they will do so as a brotherhood of
                many. There are no kings here, save the Red Pharaoh himself.
                • Always respect the commands of those in later Hours
                The priests, and also the warriors and faithful witches who plumb the depths of Duat ahead of you, have made ready
                the path you yourself travel. You are free, but they are more free. Their wisdom and guidance must be observed.
                • Always do what is necessary to test another’s resistance to liberation
                What an individual might think of as “compassion” is, to the Setite mind, nothing less than violence. In refusing to test
                another soul’s limit for freedom, you are dooming it to slavery and denying Set his due. Do not wait for permission
                when their liberty could begin now.
                • Always seek the mysteries of Set, hidden throughout the world
                The more Mysteries a Setite understands, and the more secrets they wield, the better they will serve the Red God
                and his Church.
                • Always do what is necessary to test the flaws in a social order
                Beware the individual who desires authority. Organizations both mortal and Kindred are inherently degenerate by
                virtue of their disconnection from the true god. If they are really as inviolate as they claim to be, then they must be
                brought into service of Set’s living Church, or otherwise dismantled and allowed to rot.

                 Mithra and the Bull

                     The Persian deity Mithra accomplished many great deeds, but none greater than slaying
                 the bull. He rode the creature until it was exhausted, then forced it into a cave and killed
                 it. This myth is retold over and over on steles and shrines dedicated to Mithra, and the
                 bull-slaying myth even carried over into Mithras’ Roman and British cults.
                     Yet these same myths name Sol Invictus, the Sun God, as Mithra’s patron. Does it
                 not seem odd to accomplish such a great deed away from your patron’s gaze? Most Kindred
                 dismiss the myth as allegory, or point out that Mithra as Cainite had to retreat into a
                 cave. They’re not paying attention. Myths are allegories, yes, but they are also intentional.
                 This one, specifically, names both the patron Sun and the cave. That’s not an error —
                 Mithra performed his greatest kill away from his patron’s gaze.
                     And this, my dear neonate, is where I urge you to stop and think. Who would serve as
                 patron to one as ancient as Mithras? Who would Mithras fear enough to hide his actions
                 from? What does slaying a bull, a symbol of fertility and procreation, embody? Rumors
                 have long named Mithras as Fourth Generation, yet not a direct childe of our clan founder.
                 Perhaps both are true.

            consideration that they are some of the “edges” in need
            of shaving.
                  Just as Setites and infernalists helped bring down
            Michael’s Constantinople, Pakourianis’ Johannesburg
            has saboteurs chipping away at his grand plan. Due to
            Pakourianis’ status as a direct childe of Michael, if he
            fails, the entire faith may fall with him. That is of no
            concern to the Church of Caine, however, as the Gnos-
            tics in Jo’burg consider Pakourianis’ cult a foul heresy.
            They take exception to the view of Michael as keeper of
            the Trinity, savior, or guiding light for Kindred. There
            should only be one angel in their view, and that angel
            is Caine. Led by a priest named Jabulani, the Gnostics
            aim to poison other Kindred against Pakourianis, citing
            his sire’s infamous fall, the Dove’s own predilections for

            gradually changing, however, since whereas the Ama-
            ranthans used to primarily target Sabbat vampires, with
            that sect out of the picture and the cult having no desire
            to follow them on their Gehenna Crusade, they’ve since
            taken out a few high-profile Camarilla targets, including
            an Archon and two Princes.
                  The Amaranthans are dedicated to their goal even
            though they know it’s one without end. If their practice
            was a disincentive to commit diablerie, it surely would
            have stopped diablerists by now. The current objective
            of the already small cult is to survive renewed Camarilla
            and Anarch scrutiny while furthering their more esoteric
            aims, which if rumors are to believed, involve the dia-
            blerie of some of their most dangerous targets. Supposed-
            ly, the Amaranthans believe they can free or merge with
            Amarantha if they can finally consume her murderer, but
            that would entail consuming that vampire’s descendants,
            all of whom show a similar dedication to cannibalism.


            Cleopatrans
                 Nosferatu tell tales of the wise, beautiful childe of
            their progenitor, named Yima, who was Embraced before
            Absimiliard — the clan founder — was cursed. She rode
            out God’s great storm and Caine’s ire through charm,
            love, and honesty.
                 Other Nosferatu tales tell of Yima being the one
            Nosferatu who stood between Caine and the Antedilu-
            vian, bearing the full brunt of the clan’s monstrous bane
            as Absimiliard only took a fraction of the blow. Her love
            for her sire was such that she would die or be forever
            mutilated on his behalf.
                 Rather than receiving her sire’s affection and care,
            Absimiliard abandoned her to her monstrosity. Or, her
            beauty so awesome in his sight, Absimiliard could no
            longer bear to look upon her. The tales are contradictory,
            but what is known, is Yima became the clan’s holy grail as
            a figure of sympathy or aspiration.
                 The cult known as the Cleopatrans of Yima, or just
            the Cleopatrans, formed at the height of Caesar Augustus’
            Rome, with rumors of Yima spreading widely in the wake
            of Cleopatra. This pharaoh, more powerful than any man,
            beautiful and deadly, bewitched the Roman Nosferatu
            imagination, and parallels were drawn between her and
            ancient Yima.
                 The Nosferatu started adorning their hideous faces
            and bodies with paint, baubles, masks, and elaborate
            outfits, to accentuate beauty and prove their purpose as
            more than horrors and lepers. The Cleopatrans selected
            only the canniest wits to make their cult of advisors and
            leaders, creating a bubble in time between the 1st and
            4th centuries CE where Nosferatu occupied rare places

                          So many people will tell you “this is how you make more money,” “this is where to invest
                        your cash,” and “trust me with your savings, I’m a banker.” Don’t believe everything you
                       read or hear. These shysters will rob you blind and leave you destitute. Every recession to
                      date has been the fault of greedy brokers who don’t care for their clients’ wealth so long as
                                                      they take home fat bonuses.

                          Since time immemorial, the Church has been a safe pair of hands. The Catholics haven’t
                      lined the Vatican with gold because they’re poor. In fact, they’ve been rich for 2000 years.
                        That’s longer than any other single group in the world. So, it’s time to open the doors and
                                              allow people to once again invest in religion.

                   Voice 2 (Unknown, Female?, Late 20s or 30s): I’m sorry. I really am sorry. I know
                   how important it was that we get it, but the cops.
                   Voice 1: Where is it now?
                   Voice 2: Best guess is it’s still there. We can send someone to retrieve it now, if
                   you give the word.

                   Voice 2: If they’re aware of the Order, then we need to close up shop. Immediately.
                   Voice 3 (Margaret Thales, Confirmed): Father, how have you been?
                   Voice 1: Margaret! My goodness, I didn’t see you there. I’m well. I’m well. And have
                   you met [indiscernible noise].
                   Voice 2: A pleasure.
                   Voice 1: We were just talking about some equipment we lost. A stupid thing.
                   Voice 3: Lost? Where?
                   Voice 1: A building site. Here. Let me show you the map on my phone. Here. One of
                   our students dropped something of importance. Something the college owns. But the
                   student can’t go back there because they’ve headed out of town.
                   Voice 3: Do you need me to go out and get it? I don’t mind. It’s not that far from
                   where my boyfriend lives.
                   Voice 2: That would be wonderful. Thank you so much, Margaret!
                   Voice 1: You are an angel.

                      “As I entered church today, I heard a few of you bemoaning your lack of cash. Your scarcity of capital.
              Your absence of money. Well let me tell you, my friends: money does not occupy these seats. Money does not fill a heart.
                 Money cannot hear my words. More important than money is the soul. And I see a lot of souls out there tonight.

                                                         within the cult. They understand the basic tenets of
                                                         the faith and are both able and willing to carry out the
                                                         commands of their superiors. Initiates have committed
                                                         themselves to the cause, and while they may have lin-

                                                         on the positive aspects of the cult and tend to ignore
                                                         or deny any doubts voiced by others.
                                                              Initiates who have committed to the cult’s agenda
                                                         usually perform essential nightly tasks to keep the be-

                                                         messengers, traveling between cities in order to recruit

                                                         assisting leaders in their religious services. Finally,
                                                         Initiates may serve as soldiers tasked with guard duty,

                                                               Acolytes are the most fanatical members of the
                                                         cult. They have followed its precepts, participated in
                                                         its rites, and have been rewarded for their devotion.
                                                         They spearhead short-term missions or coordinate
                                                         some aspect of the cult. When a cult needs to get its
                                                         hands bloody, an Acolyte tends to lead the charge.
                                                         They are the first to volunteer their services and the
                                                         first to put down dissent. For them the cult is their
                                                         entire identity and the only real source of purpose in

                                                         ranging from shock troops to secretaries. They are the
                                                         bread and butter of the cult. These people support the
                                                         cult because they have tied their lives and livelihood
                                                         to it.

                                                         sheep. They can perform all of the major rites, handle
                                                         internal disputes, and conduct religious services.
                                                         Smaller cults may have a single Clergyperson who
                                                         serves as the right hand of the highest authority.
                                                         Larger cults may have more, with each focusing on
                                                         an aspect like financial, organizational, or spiritual

                A Letter from Laylah Froud of the Bahari

                    Khal,
                    I’ve been thinking a lot about last week’ s discussion on the differences between a
                witch and a priest, how each has different duties and methods. While I agree with
                you that the witch grows and prunes and the priest codifies, I think there’ s a great deal
                more fluidity between the two roles than you allow. I am well aware that the Church of
                Set requires, well, set roles for all things, but there is no reason a priest couldn’ t receive
                visions or a witch couldn’ t set canon.
                    I suppose it’ s our difference in upbringing, so to speak. I know the Church has the
                Order of Taweret, what I would call a Bahari sect within the Church itself. As a fol-
                lower of Lilith, I find myself at home with your witches in the Order, the Kindred who
                mix growth and law. In a sense, you could say they are the counterbalance to the larger
                church, the life to your god of death.
                    (Let it be known, of course, that I do not revile Set in any way. Set is simply a
                new frontier, held by a masculine-presenting force, that I have yet to explore!)
                    I look forward to hearing more of your thoughts on the subject. I know you’re busy,
                so take your time in getting back to me.

                     Yours sincerely,
                     Laylah Froud

                A Letter from Khaled al-Fakhani of the Church of Set

                    Honored Laylah Froud,
                    As much as I appreciate your views on the Walid al-Set, I think you lose
                something from not having a formal education within the ranks of the faithful. There
                is much to be found within the exploration of pain, but you are not bringing your
                work to the great scholars and either letting it stand up or watching it crumble. To
                be frank: you have no network of orthodoxy to fall back on, no one to objectively say
                that your communications with Lilith have been, indeed, with Lilith. That is why you
                don’t understand the priesthood.
                    I don’t mean to say, of course, that I disbelieve in the Typhonic Mother. Quite
                the opposite. One would be a fool to think that an entity called Lilith does not exist
                in some capacity. It would also be foolish, further, to think that this entity has not
                been speaking to you through some means. Looking at you with enough Auspex clears
                that up immediately. This letter is not about diminishing your own faith within the
                Order of Taweret, but you did ask for my thoughts, and unfortunately they come
                with a preamble.
                    Let us look at the largest religions in the world as of right now: Christianity and
                Islam. Within Christianity, the largest denomination is the Roman Catholic Church.
                In Islam, the Ahl as-Sunnah, or the Sunni Muslims, are almost 90% of the popu-
                lation of the faithful. Why is that?
                    I posit to you it is the strong network each denomination possesses. You were
                raised in the United States, so perhaps Catholicism will be an easier comparison for
                you. The priest guides the spiritual well-being of his flock. The bishops guide their
                flock of priests. The cardinals guide their bishops, and the Pope is the Shepherd
                of all Shepherds, the throne of God on Earth. Doctrine is passed down from hand
                to hand, solidified and codified through the repetition of the faithful. There is, of
                course, personal gnosis, but you know when that revelation comes from your god —
                there are hundreds of texts and mountains of theology to look to.
                    This brings me to my second posit: a priest is a link in this network. To keep the
                faith strong and stable, to express the faith outwards and help others seek the truth
                — that is the duty of a priest.
                    This of course does not mean that witches don’t have their faith. A priest is meant
                to pull from the theology and canon set down by other priests before him. So it is in
                Catholic Christianity with the Bible and papal letters and bulls, so it is in Sunni
                Islam with the hadith and the Quran. A priest is a conduit for the faith as it is. A
                witch goes into the spirit of the faith itself and pulls out new meaning for herself

                 and others. She may not always be listened to — she may even be a heretic, and
                 burned for it, as so many were — but a witch wields the power of the faith and
                 grows it, whereas a priest tends to the faithful and the doctrine. A faith that is all
                 witches is a philosophy, a faith that is all priests grows stagnant.
                    I hope this helps with your confusion. I remain, as always, your faithful friend.

     CulTs of The blood Gods




                An Accord Between Faiths

                     Khal,
                     I admit, it took me three fucking readings of your letter to read it without getting pissed.
                Being told I don’ t know what I’m doing is a good way of getting to me — but I think
                you knew that when you wrote that letter. I would expect nothing less from a Priest of Set,
                especially one who knows I prefer to learn through, shall we say, visceral methods.
                     I agree with you that a religion which is all witches is more of a philosophy. Some people
                who read Dolium’s Revelations of the Dark Mother mistake the Bahari for an organized
                religion with pointlessly sadistic methods. Those people are fools. Each Ba’ham is a witch and
                a religion in her own right, her own temple and pope and sacred scripture. To destroy that
                is to destroy a precious resource. A cult of Bahari is like several different sects trying to
                work together on a long-term interfaith project. It can work, of course, but eventually we will
                leave to seek friends elsewhere. There is only so much one person can teach us — luckily I
                have a lot more to learn from you!
                     There is gnosis to be had here, and to be had elsewhere as well. A human can never fully
                know themself and their own depths — but as vampires, we have infinite time. I mean to
                learn and learn and learn until my very body is torn away and all that remains is the glory
                of the garden of knowledge that I will become. I understand that priests cannot have this
                experience, and for that I pity them.
                     A priest must be solid and stable. I cannot follow that route. I have never been able to
                follow that route, and I do not look nor hope to at any point. If I am to take on an appren-
                tice or an acolyte, I might do that, but then they will change in their own way, and their
                faith will not be the same as mine. To see you with your childer is to watch you shaping
                clay, and while that is beautiful, I would much rather be planting and growing a tree. I
                want to see that life that they take on without me, without my name attached.
                     As always, thank you so much for allowing me a position within the Church of Set to
                continue practicing and discussing my faith in safety. It means so much more to me than you
                know.
                     I look forward to seeing you again next Elysium.

                    Yours sincerely,
                    Laylah Froud

                  This Ceremony allows a vampire to bend a wraith to
            their will.

                  Ingredients: A wraith’s fetter, the caster’s vitae, an
            item (or threat) sufficient to damage the fetter.
                  Process: The vampire must be in close proximity to a
            wraith in order to use this power, typically through use of
            Summon Spirit (see p. 209). The necromancer casts a hand-
            ful of their own vitae in the wraith’s direction as they hold
            a destructive item to the fetter (a knife, a hammer, a gun, or
            potentially holding the fetter over a fire) or speak threatening
            words that the wraith believes. The vampire and wraith engage
            in a contest of wills. If the vampire gains domination over the
            wraith, the wraith must serve as the vampire decrees, at least
            temporarily. If the opposite occurs, the vampire is left mental-         sensibilities, etc.). On a critical win, the vampire can

                                         (BLOODL I N E; H EC ATA CH A R ACT E R S ON LY )




              S      ometime around the 18th century, the Giovanni
                     wanted a foothold in the markets of the New World.
                     But all of their attempts were constantly blocked by a
              Scottish family of bankers who owned several shipping ven-
              tures. Impressed by their financial acumen, the Giovanni
              investigated bringing the family into the fold. What closed
              the deal was the discovery that the Dunsirn were cannibals
              as well as financiers. It was the perfect balance of money,
              depravity, and ability to keep a secret.
                   For centuries, the relationship between the two
              families was clear: The Dunsirn made the money, and the
              Giovanni family spent it like water. Surprisingly, even
              though mortal members of the Dunsirn family still indulge
              in the occasional bit of “long pork,” the Kindred don’t show
              much aptitude or interest in necromantic pursuits. Prior to
              the Family Reunion, there was an effort to force them into
              learning the ways of Oblivion, but now the Dunsirns are
              happy to go back to what they do best: bleeding people dry.
                   And this time, they don’t need to answer to the
              fucking Giovanni to do it, either.

                                                                          LORE

            I    n the early sixteenth century, Spanish Giovanni met
                 representatives of the Aztec civilization as part of the
                 Cortes expeditions. In the city of Tenochtitlan (now part
            of Mexico City), these Giovanni were introduced to a massive,
            formalized necromantic tradition. So naturally they killed,
            enslaved, and converted the “heathens,” bringing them into the
            fold. The Giovanni called these converts pisanob, a Mayan term
            that roughly translates to “ghosts of the dead that walk the
            Earth” (the fact that the Aztecs weren’t Mayan didn’t concern
            the Europeans). That these vampires already had a name, a
            legacy, and their own beliefs mattered little to the Giovanni.
                  Their leader, Pochtli, was still in charge of the Pisanob
            up through the Family Reunion. However, the family had
            been whittled down to a bare few remaining Kindred after
            the ongoing attacks by the Harbingers of Skulls, although
            the reasons for the attacks were unknown. Pochtli offered
            his unlife to the Harbingers in exchange for an end to hos-
            tilities, which the Harbingers accepted.
                  Now, the remaining children of Tenochtitlan are
            deciding on a new leader, while planning their revenge.

            T        he Nagaraja are the most wayward of vampires
                     in a clan now full of wayward vampires. They
                     believe themselves to be the first ever necroman-
            cers. They revel in the fact that their lineage is not easy
            to trace back to one of the known Antediluvians. They
            believe they once mastered the lands of the dead, having
            converted their Blood to live in such a place. And, per-
            haps as a result of said Ceremony, they ate human flesh
            in lieu of drinking blood. They believe one night they
            can become masters of the Underworld again.
                  The Nagaraja are rightly seen as bogeymen, as they
            number but few and advocate for the horrible prac-
            tice of capturing mortals and stripping them of flesh

              H         olding the Jyhad’s longest grudge, the Cappadocians
                        were the Clan of Death before they were usurped by the
                        upstart Giovanni. Believed for centuries to be destroyed,
              the Cappadocians either took to wearing masks and calling them-
              selves the “Harbingers of Skulls” or a subfaction of the clan named
              themselves “Harbingers” generations before. Whatever the truth,
              the majority joined the Sabbat and worked aggressively against
              Giovanni interests. For many years it was thought that both sides
              would never stop until one obliterated the other, but that appears
              to have changed with the Family Reunion.
                    Despite the reconciliation and the acknowledgment of
              the remnants of the Cappadocian Kindred, the Harbingers
              of Skulls as they were could no longer exist. But neither
              could the Cappadocians return to their former state after
              so many centuries of anger. As such, these vampires respond
              to either name, but they have become some synthesis of the
              two. Like all things, the past form has died, and enriched
              the earth so that something new can grow.

            U         ntil recently, whenever an outsider Kindred
                      thought about the Clan of Death, they pictured
                      the Giovanni family. Their origins stretch back
            before the Roman Empire (when they were known as the
            Ioveanus or Jovians), and the entire time they’ve had their
            hands in Kindred affairs. The original Giovanni family
            knows how to play the game better than anyone, crafting
            an identity as “Devil Kindred” to strike the right balance
            of fear and respect in their rivals — and their relatives.
                  The Giovanni family and the clan of vampires known
            as the Giovanni are not identical, but it was a useful
            fiction for centuries. However, now that the Family
            Reunion has caused a restructuring of the Clan of Death,
            the original family refuses to be left out in the cold. As
            much as some cousins would like to see the backside of la
            famiglia, the “true” Giovanni aren’t just going to stand by
            and let thousands of years of family history get tossed out
            due to some political convenience. They are the top dogs,
            and they’ll murder to retain that position.
                  After all, no one fights like a family.

              F      or a few decades, the Giovanni had a reputation
                     as being nothing more than vampire mobsters.
                     Savvy Hecata ancillae confronted by such ethnic
              stereotypes in Camarilla Elysia laugh and suggest the
              rumor started from too many late-night showings of
              The Godfather. And once the Hecata gets a chance to slip
              away, they call their cousins and ask what the fucking
              Puttanesca have done this time.
                   The fucking Puttanesca family, as they’re often
              called by other Hecata, were acquired from Sicily in
              the 1660s as talented street hustlers — perfect for dirty,
              low-level jobs that the more moneyed Giovanni couldn’t
              be bothered to handle. Over the years, these Puttanescas
              leaned into the mafioso stereotypes, because you might
              as well be a legbreaker if you break legs for a living.
              After the Family Reunion, any remaining connections
              to organized crime have been quickly shuffled over to
              the Puttanescas. The anziani say it’s a reward for loyal
              service. But the Puttanesca know it’s a way to put all the
              Hecata’s embarrassing assets in one place.                         little guy before you get beat on by a bigger guy. But
                   So if they’re going to be “the fucking Puttanesca,”           soon they’ll be the big guy, and it’ll be everyone else that
              that’s fine. This family knows all about beating on the            gets fucked.

            T         he Lamiae were a bloodline of Kindred believed to
                      be descended from Lilith as well as Caine — their
                      founder and high priestess (named Lamia) claimed
            to be the daughter of the Dark Mother herself. In ancient
            times, a Cappadocian elder found Lamia performing sacred
            Bahari rites, and was so taken by her skin and resistance to
            pain that he Embraced her. From then on, the Lamiae were
            dedicated warriors protecting the Cappadocian clan, until

            Lamia was believed destroyed in 1718.
                   However, the Gorgons lived on, much like their Cappadocian
            charges. While the latter claimed the title “Harbingers of Skulls,”
            the Lamiae took the title of “Lilins,” spreading the word of Lilith
            and the Bahari faith while secretly uncovering the fate of the
            Cappadocians and undermining the Giovanni. Now, in the wake
            of the Family Reunion, these women stand proudly once again at
            the side of the Kindred that Embraced them — although they are
            less inclined to tolerate so-called “Cainites” that chastise their faith
            or insult their martial skill.

              in another vampire’s head — and the subsequent un-

            T        hat which is perfect is beautiful. That which is
                     beautiful is good. That which is good leads to
                     utopia. This is what the Nephilim believe — that
            if they can embody all that is beautiful and perfect, they
            can recreate the utopic dream of the perfect Kindred city:
            Constantinople. A recent cult chided in equal parts as a
            Toreador fever dream and an excuse for lavish parties, the
            Nephilim nevertheless draws in a large share of propo-
            nents, eager to ogle the great and the good, or to find
            ways to improve themselves toward their personal ideal.
                 Of course, the pursuit of ideal perfection shouldn’t
            be sullied by base concerns like money or power. Those
            that give up all that they hold dear to the Nephilim will
            be rewarded, becoming more perfect and more beauti-
            ful with each passing night. Besides, once the Dream of
            Constantinople comes to pass and all vampires are living
            in harmony, none of that will matter anyway. Right?
            You might be a seeker of beauty, or one of the beautiful
            yourself, but you’re definitely invested in the Dream, one
            way or another.

                                 SE RV ITOR OF I R A D
              A         ccording to the Book of Nod, Irad the Strong was
                        the third childe of Caine, and he served as his
                        sire’s enforcer and military leader in the First
              City. The Kindred of the Servitors of Irad seek to emulate
              that mythological vampire, who is said to have pledged
              to serve the Antediluvians in all things before his kin or
              his childer destroyed him. They hope that, if they spend
              their existence showing they serve the Antediluvians, they
              will be spared when the ancients rise. Irad believed it, but
              received the revelation too late to preserve himself.
                    The cult doesn’t actually have any contact with the
              Third Generation, but they assume that the Antediluvians
              would want the elders of Kindred society to be weak and
              divided. As such, they infiltrate any vampiric organization
              they can find — Camarilla cities, Anarch gatherings, and
              even other cults — to sow dissension and shatter fragile
              alliances. And now you’re one such deep cover member.
              You’re cut off from the other members of your cult, trying

              you’d be immediately and painfully killed. But you have
              faith, and that’s enough.
                                                                         LORE

            A         fter the Giovanni engineered the fall of the
                      Cappadocians (or so they thought), the up-and-
                      coming Camarilla expressed concerns about the
            so-called “Devil Clan.” The purge of the Cappadocians
            entered full force soon after the Anarch Revolt, and the
            Kindred of the Camarilla were worried that this was
            more of the same. With the upstart Anarchs forming
            into what would become the Sabbat, the Camarilla
            couldn’t afford a war on yet another front. So, Augustus
            Giovanni and the Inner Circle of the Camarilla met in
            Venice in 1528, and signed an agreement.
                 The problem is, no one really knows what’s in the
            agreement. For years, all that was known was that the
            Giovanni had some degree of autonomy in Camarilla
            domains, and that the clan was given ownership of
            the city of Venice (in exchange for the Inner Circle
            being allowed to hold their meetings there). After the
            Family Reunion, however, an additional detail has been
            revealed: The Promise has a limit of 500 years, meaning            are scrambling to find out the details of the agreement,
            it will expire in 2028. Both the Camarilla and the Hecata          as well as the consequences once it expires.

               C H A R AC T E R S
               Player characters in this story likely hail from the Hecata, but there is no restriction on clans one might play. Likewise,
               while the story does not involve itself in the politics of the Camarilla or Anarch Movements, characters may still hold
               affiliation with either sect, or indeed a cult beyond the Hecata. While it may seem strange for the Hecata to involve
               non-clan members in their internal affairs, it does in fact serve multiple purposes: this plot highlights the apolitical
               veneer of the Hecata, allows the clan to find reliable mercenaries from outside the family, and enables them to forge
               close contacts with members of the other sects and cults without the need to pin their banner to any particular view
               or philosophy.
               Characters in this story can be local to Munich and invited to the family dinner in the prologue due to prior history
               with the Hecata, or may be from outside the domain, summoned in to perform the task at hand. The Hecata are
               always happy to reward out-of-clan vampires with money and property, of which they hold plenty, with a harder
               bargain eking Oblivion knowledge out of a potential Mawla awarded for good service. If the vampires are from
               within the Hecata, it is their duty to serve the family and further the clan’s goals, knowing rewards should (in theory)
               trickle down from their elders for good, loyal service.

     CULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS

               While this story is set in the city of Munich, it can easily be transposed into another domain with minimal adjustment.
               We recommend that if you decide to move this story to another domain, you pick out a dozen locations of note from
               within the city, small and large. If for instance you wanted to set this in the domain of Dallas, the Sixth Floor Museum
               at Dealey Plaza is a site forever associated with the murder of JFK, making for an ominous Hecata meeting spot. The
               Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Gardens make for excellent neutral ground for meetings between the sects. Mean-
               while, on a smaller scale the Nasher Sculpture Center makes for a bizarre setting to host a showdown, while one
               could easily state the Bishop Arts District is a territory firmly in Clan Toreador’s hands. Set dressing is key to making
               a city feel true to life.
               The primary players have been created for this story, therefore names and clans can change, allowing the Prince to
               become a Malkavian, or even for the Hecata surroundings to become those of the Ministry or Tremere, given both
               clans share a sense of internal order. The necromantic element of this story could be replaced with Blood Sorcery or
               some arcane rituals another clan practices in secret.
               We recommend you use Munich if you do not have a present domain for your stories, but if you have already fleshed
               out your setting, use it and migrate your personalities, sites, and events into this tale.

                 HANDOUT #1: THE AUCTION INVITATION




                     You are cordially invited to a private auction held in the Industrial Park
                  South in Feldkirchen at 10:00PM. My agents will be waiting to escort you to and
                  from the warehouse.

                     Up for auction is a burial jar of ancient origin, recently found during an ar-
                  chaeological dig in Venice. Its provenance has been accurately dated to the third
                  century, and it was once possessed by Augustus Giovanni. According to documents
                  found on site, he used the jar to call upon those dearly departed.

                     No violence will be permitted during the auction. Any found to be using their
                  particular gifts in order to secure said item will be dealt with harshly. Please
                  bring with your patience an open wallet and a worthy temperament.

              HANDOUT #3: A LETTER


                      Family,

                     I trust you receive this letter in the spirit it is written. For I am Hecata and
                 bear no ill will toward my family. I did deceive Asano, and I did use his dear
                 Hildebrant for my own ends, but my actions were in furtherance of the clan.

                     Constancia almost succeeded in completing her ceremony. While this proves
                 somewhat disappointing, it does invite further study. For if we Hecata have the
                 means of monitoring an entire city or traveling across Munich via the shadows in the
                 merest blink of an eye, then we have the means of redefining our destiny. We may yet
                 emerge from the ashes of our past and reclaim our place in the Jyhad. We may yet
                 escape from underneath the boot of the Camarilla and define, for ourselves, exactly who
                 and what we are. The destiny I strive to create. I do not apologize for seeking to better
                 my family, though I regret this inconvenienced so many in the interim.

                     I depart to continue my great work. Should our paths cross again, I will embrace
                 you as my blood, and pray you understand the full depth of my actions. Until then,
                 I bid you a goodnight. For we are the end and the beginning. And we yet remain
                 from now and for all time.

                      Sincerely,
                      Mora

            After five grueling years, he joined the elite Kommando
