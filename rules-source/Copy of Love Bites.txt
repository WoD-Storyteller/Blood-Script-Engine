                         you with escorting her grandchilde to a New Year’s Eve party in the Nosferatu warrens. Her
                         only requirement is that you return him to her before dawn without a scratch on his precious
                         head. What could possibly go wrong?

             meets politics. On New Year’s Eve, the Prince entrusts           A Nosferatu cult, known as the Cleopatrans of Yima,
             an up-and-coming Maréchal coterie with what seems                formed at the height of Caesar Augustus’ Rome.
             like an easy task: escort her prodigal grandchilde,              Most Kindred believed they disappeared with the fall
             Gatsby, to a Nosferatu party hosted by visiting                  of the Western Roman Empire. However, rumors

                 GATSBY, SPOILED BON VIVANT (DIFFICULTY 3)
                 Gatsby is a walking, talking, blood-sucking master of ceremonies. With a rolodex of contacts
                 and seemingly limitless wealth, every night with him is a smorgasbord of hedonism. Yet,
                 his true talent is in his capacity to make others feel seen and valued. Through his
                 intense, captivating gaze, a tailored personal question, and the subtle reassurance
                 of a placed hand, he deftly dismantles even the most formidable social defenses.
                 Once he breaches someone’s reservations, Gatsby’s inherent Toreador charm
                 unfurls, making the individual feel extraordinary.

                 The tall and impeccably dressed ghoul, Clement, stands by
                 patiently, surrounded by an extensive collection of the latest
                 high-fashion clothing. Here lies an opportunity for the players’
                 characters to indulge — or not indulge — their inner haute couture.

                 in a rich shade of aubergine, there is no price too high. Conversely,
                 if a character’s style is more street, Clement can provide an array of
                 garments from bomber jackets to band t-shirts. The Prince spares no
                 expense or inconvenience and includes a few handpicked items based

                 available for characters who prefer to be armed. The arsenal includes
                 an array of knives, clubs, swords, pistols, and shotguns, though all
                 strictly civilian grade. Clement issues a gentle reminder that the city
                 is swarming with police tonight, and firearms could risk unwanted
                 attention. From a storytelling perspective, this scene can show the
                 benefits of working for the Prince, and you can highlight the access
                 the characters have to luxury and weaponry.
                    Gatsby selects a sharp white suit, a medium-sized pistol, and two
                 new blood dolls to accompany him to the ground floor, where their
                 car awaits.

                                                            Chapter Two:

                                       ROAD

             upscale SUV to head to the Cleopatra party. The                    brisk twenty-minute drive. But tonight, the New Year’s
             vehicle comfortably carries nine passengers and                    Eve festivities have the roads gridlocked. As the coterie
             has leather seats, a tinted moonroof, and premium                  sits in traffic, Gatsby seizes the conversation. The self-
             surround sound. Dressed in customary black, the                    styled master of icebreaking asks about everyone’s New

             she woke up with a bad case of the undeads. She knew               “Anyone care for a taste?”
             something had happened to her when she returned to

                      GATSBY AND MIRIAM
                      Both Gatsby and Miriam offer no hint of their affair. Miriam maintains her
                      professionalism, while Gatsby seems interested in anyone but her. He even talks down to
                      her when opportunities present themselves, treating her like the help. While not cruel
                      or abusive, he does let his chauvinistic and elitist sides shine. Miriam grits her teeth and
                      bears it knowing their freedom lies on the other side of the night.
                         However, if a character wants to zero in on how Miriam feels, a simple test of Resolve
                      + Insight with a Difficulty of 3 reveals that she’s annoyed but hopeful. And it’s the hope
                      that might seem just a bit strange under the circumstances.


                      For new players or experienced players portraying new characters, the car ride lets
                      characters get to know each other and build rapport. Don’t shy away from using
                      Gatsby as a foil for the other characters. Their reactions to his antics can be part of the
                      fun. The coterie is also free to ask questions of Gatsby and Miriam. Miriam will answer
                      questions as straightforward as possible unless they risk exposing their plan. If anyone
                      asks why she’s a branded member of the Camarilla, she replies that the Camarilla found
                      her first. A simple test of Wits + Insight with a Difficulty 2 reveals that while Miriam is
                      being factually accurate, she’s anxious about talking about herself — or at least talking
                      about herself while in front of a coterie loyal to the Prince.
                         By contrast, Gatsby is unabashedly talkative. He converses fluently about the latest
                      trends and bounces from one topic to another — the recent Hollywood scandal, fashion
                      choices at the Met Gala, the newest tech gadget, and so on. If the players are using the
                      pre-generated characters from the Appendix: Players’ Coterie, Gatsby has seen Catalina’s
                      work, heard of Dania’s Adelina Fairfax series, and knows both Montgomery and Nonso
                      by reputation. Ethan and Rhatha, on the other hand, he doesn’t know. If pressed on
                      anything remotely close to a serious question, Gatsby deftly changes the subject.




                                                                  11

                       here. We’ve chosen to be here in this city. So, once a year, we get to come together.
                       We talk and laugh and mourn and party hard because it’s a new year. It’s a fresh

                       over the balcony railing, and lands effortlessly on the dance floor below as revelers
                       swarm him. With thirty seconds to spare, the party becomes a live countdown. Ten
                       seconds pass, then another ten, a sense of anticipation building with each second.

                       out the music. Kindred press close to their partners, sealing the new year with a kiss
                       or sinking their fangs into a mortal who may or may not be a blood doll as scorched
                       confetti rains from rusted overhead pipes. For a fleeting moment, the chamber becomes a
                       spectacle of swirling paper, dazzling light, and reverberating sound. But as that moment
                       passes and the confetti storm calms, Gatsby is nowhere in sight.

    VAMPIRE: THE MASQUERADE




                                  Catalina Luca
                                  (Jaded Actor, Captain)
                         Like so many young women with arresting beauty and raw talent, Catalina Luca chased
                         the illusive dream of stardom in the neon-veined heart of Hollywood. But years as a
                         background extra and a season regular on a canceled show forced her to reckon with her
                         non-existent career. Driven to reinvent herself, she channeled her physical prowess into
                         stunt work, finding a place in the industry where agility mattered more than connections.
                           Catalina’s entrance to the Ivory Tower came after crossing paths with a Toreador
                         producer on the set of an action flick. She persisted in thinking she was suffering from a
                         hangover resulting from an on-set late night party up until she blearily opened the curtains
                         in the morning and almost burned to a crisp. She immediately recognized the parallels
                         between the Camarilla court’s pageantry and Hollywood’s narcissism and flourished
                         among vanity-drunk fiends, flattery-addicted schemers, and back-stabbing friends.
                         The role she plays now on behalf of the city’s Toreador Prince is her most significant
                         performance to date.

                         Motivation: Rising Star
                         Catalina longs to find the fame that eluded her in Hollywood. She craves the intoxicating
                         mix of fear and respect she sees in the eyes of others when they talk about powerful
                         Kindred. As captain of the coterie, she hopes to prove her worth and earn the same.

                                         Montgomery Boucher
                                         (Indomitable Hockey Player, Master at Arms)
                        A crushing bodycheck against the boards ended Montgomery Boucher’s career in the hockey
                        rink, shattering his femur in three spots and cracking his kneecap. A grueling nine-hour
                        surgery mended his bones but couldn’t return him to the ice. So, he swapped his skates for a
                        coach’s whistle while taking on side gigs as a personal trainer and bouncer. But his formidable
                        fighting skills and tenacious spirit eventually earned him the Embrace, disorienting and
                        horrifying as it was.
                           Montgomery may not understand the intricacies of undead politics or why the Gangrel
                        have almost entirely aligned themselves with the Anarch Movement, but he likes being
                        part of a team. And the Maréchal coterie has become more than just a group of Kindred to
                        him. It’s his family, his pack, a place where he isn’t just acknowledged but valued.

                        Motivation: Team Player
                        Motivated by team unity, Montgomery thrives when working alongside others and strives
                        to foster a sense of camaraderie within his coterie. He believes in their collective strength
                        and is determined to maintain cohesion against all odds.

    VAMPIRE: THE MASQUERADE




                                  Dania Nowak
                                  (Insightful Novelist, Veteran Member)
                                   Dania Nowak threw herself into the lion’s den of the literary world, determined
                                   to see her name on a book cover. After countless rejections, an agent finally
                         agreed to represent her, and Dania published her Adelina Fairfax series about a reclusive
                         bibliophile and linguist who uses her vast knowledge of languages, symbols, and codes to
                         solve crimes. While she was by no means famous, she had a growing audience of devoted
                         readers, one of whom tried to murder Dania when Adelina Fairfax died in the final book.
                           She remembers little from that violent night but can recall someone pushing her over
                         a bridge and a stranger dragging her out of the river, culminating in a shocking Embrace.
                         Existence as a vampire has been difficult for Dania, but she is slowly leaving her old life
                         behind. In the meantime, Dania uses her knack for unearthing secrets and mysteries for
                         her sect and coterie.

                         Motivation: New Chapters
                         Lately, Dania has chosen to view her transformation into a vampire as an unexpected
                         plot twist in her own narrative. Each night presents a chance to add to her ongoing story,
                         inspiring her to write a novel like no other.

                               Ethan Holloway
                               (Unhinged Investigator,
                               Veteran Member)
                               Ethan Holloway and Tom Gerrity were far from the proud, respectable police
                               detectives the public believed them to be. The pair routinely used their badges as
                               shields covering indiscretions ranging from accepting bribes to tampering with
                      evidence. As the money rolled in, their moral compasses faded into oblivion. However, the
                      wrong side of the law caught up with them when Tom was mysteriously murdered.
                        Stricken with guilt, grief, and paranoia, Ethan’s life spiraled out of control. Revenge
                      consumed him, and his relentless pursuit of his partner’s killer became an obsession that cost
                      him his job, his family, and his sanity. But Ethan’s sire saw his potential like a flame flickering
                      amid the darkness. And in the aftermath of his Embrace, Ethan has crafted a chillingly tidy
                      unlife where he comes home each night to eat dinner alongside his perfect (and wholly
                      subjugated) wife and kids.


                      Motivation: Work-Life Balance
                      Ethan’s need to maintain the illusion of an everyday home life often conflicts with his
                      duties to the coterie and the Camarilla. However, his skill as a detective regularly proves
                      more valuable than the irritation caused by the check-in phone calls and the errands he
                      runs for his family.

    VAMPIRE: THE MASQUERADE




                                      Rhatha Khan
                                      (Subversive Cybersecurity Expert, Rookie
                                      Member)
                                       As a cybersecurity consultant, Rhatha Khan stumbled on a hidden network of
                         encrypted data streams and cloaked IP addresses. Her curiosity led her down the digital rabbit
                         hole, unearthing an archive of arcane symbols and ancient languages beyond the realm of
                         mundane cybercrime. One fateful night, she decrypted a file named “Gehenna,” and her world
                         shifted. Her apartment door creaked open, and she knew she was no longer alone.
                            The Tremere’s name was Emerick, and while he was intrigued by Rhatha’s skill and
                         ingenuity, he also grasped the danger she posed. So, he offered her a choice: eternal
                         silence or eternal unlife. With a mix of terror and fascination, she chose the latter. When
                         Emerick’s fangs pierced her neck, Rhatha’s ordinary life ended, and her journey as a
                         follower of Carna began.

                         Motivation: Unshackled Freedom
                         Even within the relative freedom of House Carna, Rhatha remains wary of any form of
                         hierarchical control. But recently, her sire Emerick has secured her a place in this prestigious
                         coterie for a reason she has yet to unravel.

                                      Nonso Okorie
                                      (Impulsive Street Racer, Rookie Member)
                                       For Nonso Okorie, the thunderous roar of engines always elicits fond
                                       memories of his father, a race car driver. Nonso had dreamt of continuing
                                       the legacy, but after a fatal accident claimed his father’s life and the prize
                       money dried up, Nonso and his mother fell on hard times. When he couldn’t afford to
                       race cars, he boosted them. And over time, he earned a reputation as a skilled car thief and
                       street racer.
                          However, destiny, dressed in a Porsche 911, caught up with Nonso when he impressed
                       its owner, a Ventrue named Marcus Vandenberg, with his ability to handle the expensive
                       machine. So, Marcus Embraced him without undue emotion beyond the terror of dying
                       and coming back as a bloodsucking creature and put him to work. Still new to his unlife,
                       Nonso has yet to fully appreciate the lethal food chain he finds himself at the bottom of.

                       Motivation: Dutiful Childe
                       As the newest and youngest coterie member, Nonso wants to show that he belongs. He
                       also knows Marcus wants a major boon over the Prince, and this is his best chance to
                       secure it — especially if the Prince finds herself in need of a getaway driver.
                          Clan: Ventrue
                          Embraced: 2020 (Born 1998)
                          Ambition: Score a major boon from the Prince
                          Desire: Earn the respect of a coterie mate
                          Predator: Scene Queen (Illegal Racing Circuit)
                          Convictions: Dare to push the limits
                          Touchstones: Sachi, a fellow street racer whose daring feats and appetite for risk have
                       been a source of inspiration for Nonso
