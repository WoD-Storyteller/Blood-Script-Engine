# Politics & City Management (Homebrew)

This rules-source file documents systems that currently lack a published rules reference
in the `rules-source/` corpus. These mechanics are implemented as house rules or tooling
support, and should be treated as unsupported by canon until a specific rules text is
sourced and linked.

## Systems covered

- **Domain taxes** (domain-to-coterie tax rules and nightly collections)
- **Boon enforcement** (deadline tracking, escalation, and enforcement status)
- **Coterie conflicts** (conflict declarations, actions, and intensity tracking)
- **Motions & votes** (proposal lifecycle, voting, and outcomes)
- **Holdings & income tracking** (coterie holding ledger and income values)
- **Faction influence scores** (numeric influence tracking by faction)
- **Night-cycle automation** (automated nightly processing and political pressure)

## Status

No official rules source file is linked for the above systems in this repo. The mechanics
remain in place as house rules. If canonical references are identified later, replace
this file with the appropriate source reference(s) and update the service comments.
