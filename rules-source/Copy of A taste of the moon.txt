    A TASTE OF THE MOON




                                    A Taste of
                                    the Moon
                          A Free RPG Day Story
                          Some have tasted it, many more talk about it: Cherry Moon. Something unusual has hit the streets:
                          blood. That doesn’t happen every night. As far as anyone knows, blood spoils and turns rancid. You
                          can’t sell it; you can’t store it. Only Kindred with robust gullets are able to subsist on blood. Yet here
                          we are, with vials of the sweet stuff on the streets.

                          Those who have chugged a vial of Cherry Moon report wild and conflicting experiences, from achieving
                          Golconda to temporarily mastering the Beast. The only constant among these stories has been the
                          berry-stained tongues of those who’ve imbibed. No one seems to know where Cherry Moon comes
                          from, what it is, or most importantly, why it’s so addictively intoxicating.

                          One thing is clear, though: Those who have partaken of Cherry Moon want more.

                          acid. Your veins pulsed. You knew you were screaming something, but you couldn’t
                          hear the words. When you looked up at the warehouse ceiling, you felt like you
                          could see through it, past the smog and clouds, and see the expansive moon before
                          you. You stared at each other for a while, the moon and you. It took a moment for
                          you to realize it was your white-faced Beast waiting. You were both silent, while
                          the room grew louder and louder. Then ever so slowly, the Beast opened its blood-
                          drenched mouth and screamed with you.

                          Fuck.

                          Everyone was right, this blood is the good shit... even when it’s growing stale.

    A TASTE OF THE MOON




                  Complications
                          In the first days of your Embrace, you assumed your sire knew everything about
                          everything. They told you so, after all. Regardless of how you felt when you were ripped
                          away from your mortal life, you relied on them. You’ve run errands for them, protected
                          them, and generally tried your best to heed their knowledgeable advice about the dangers
                          of each waking night. You’ve learned some tricks on your own as well: how to stay one
                          step ahead of the increasing surveillance of the modern world, how to find comrades, and
                          how to keep your nose mostly clean.

                          But tonight, something changes. You’re watching your sire lick the inside of a blue vial like
                          a hamster drinking from their water bottle. Suddenly things feel different. Complicated.
                          If you didn’t know any better, you’d call this a growing pain.

                          Is disillusionment with your sire a necessary part of being Kindred?

                                 The End
                           Once you were told how to recognize the sigils the thin-bloods used to mark the way
                           to the warehouse, it was a straight shot. Peeking through the frosted glass, you see
                           two individuals, probably the Duskborn dealers, hunched over a long steel table
                           covered in opened packages of candy and boxes of cherry cough syrup.

                           That explains the taste.

                           But it doesn’t explain the power.

                           No, the scarred man held by chains secured to a hook in the ceiling explains that. You
                           watch as the two thin-bloods shoot what seem to be tranquilizers into him — using
                           way more than any human could take. Enough to keep a werewolf sedated.

                           The unnerving night howls are barely drowned out by the pulsing music, but soon
                           the drugs take effect, and the howls turn into a sad whimper that leaves the man
                           slack in his chains.

                           Approaching with caution, one of the thin-bloods begins to draw his blood.




                                                                     22

    A TASTE OF THE MOON




                            MELIKA REDD
                          Keywords: Charming, Confident, Brutally Honest, Suspicious
                               Melika Redd puts the lick in lick. Statuesque and always dressed in the best, Melika’s
                          confidence exudes from every perfectly formed part of her. Her mortal life could have ended
                          in the same way those of many of her friends did. Growing up in the roughest parts of the
                          city in the ‘00s meant she was an easy target while walking home from her job as a dancer,
                          keys clutched in her hands, ready to swing. However, a chance meeting with a Kindred client
                          took off a cloak of fear she didn’t even know she wore. Taking to the night with zeal, Melika
                          has spent her nights since the Embrace secretly funneling money back to her community and
                          dancing for Kindred who assume she’s a Toreador.
                          THINGS TO DO AS MELIKA:
                          • Try something new with little to no fear of the consequences. You’ve spent enough time afraid.
                          • Throw caution to the wind and hedonistically give in to every pleasure — then worry whatever
                            you’ve done won’t be enough to satisfy you in the future.
                          • Seduce someone cute for information, and then ask if they’d like to become a snack.

    A TASTE OF THE MOON




                            CASSANDRA BARRANTES
                          Keywords: Responsible, Wise, Romantic, Neurotic
                               Cassandra knows her name fits perfectly with what happened to her — in a way doomed
                          her to become a Malkavian. In fact, as someone who’s never felt entirely right in the world of
                          the living, Cassandra knows that if she hadn’t become a lick, she would have become something
                          else… probably a werewolf, a ghost, or something like that. Considering she believes she can see
                          the lines of fate in all things, she may be correct.
                               Already a practicing occultist when she was Embraced by her Malkavian sire, Cassandra
                          didn’t see any reason to change anything about herself except being based in Miami, so she
                          decided to start unlife in a new city. Trying to break out of the demure shell she carried in life,
                          Cassandra flies under the radar as a popular YouTube tarot reader while amassing an impressive
                          collection of books on every occult subject she can think of. Of course, she hasn’t read them all,
                          but fate has personally told her she will.
                          THINGS TO DO AS CASSANDRA:
                          • Use Obfuscate to leave an awkward situation you don’t want to be a part of.
                          • Try a new drug, blood, or physical sensation in the spirit of exposing yourself to something
                            new. Instantly regret it as you worry about the threads of fate you altered while out of control.
                          • Feel compelled to look into someone’s soul without asking for permission. Tell them the worst
                            bits. It’s for their own good, honestly.

                            Clan: Malkavian
                            Embraced: 2019 (Born 1989)

                            Convictions: The innocent should be protected from beings beyond their ken. Children
                            should not suffer.

    A TASTE OF THE MOON




                            FINCH
                          Keywords: Suave, Adventurous, Dominating, Fickle
                               They don’t really like to talk about where they’re from, or what life existed beyond the
                          unlife they have right now, tonight. It’s not that they were from a broken home. It’s not that
                          they were Embraced by mistake. It’s that for Finch, every night is a new adventure, a new
                          chance to discover untold stories.
                               Finch radiates excitement and dangerous animalistic beauty, like the feeling of a bad idea
                          you’re going to do anyway. They’ve been in the city for some time with their sire, and they feel
                          like they’re ready to leave the proverbial nest. Their current mask as a bartender is wearing thin.
                          Maybe they’ll break up with their blood doll girlfriend and have one last big night on the town.
                          The road is calling.
                          THINGS TO DO AS FINCH:
                          • See if you can score a vial of something fresh that could satisfy your addiction and keep your
                            mind on task.
                          • Make someone a promise. Immediately choose to break it.
                          • Give into the Beast and revel in turning an enemy into pulp.

    A TASTE OF THE MOON




                            THOMAS NG
                          Keywords: Curious, Enthusiastic, Innovative, Petty
                               Work hard and play harder was a motto Thomas held in life, but since his Embrace, his
                          palette has greatly increased with it comes to play. Previously a nurse at a local free clinic,
                          Thomas spends half his time offering check-ups to the kine on skid row who could use a doctor.
                          The other half is for doing all the things he used to stop himself from doing because it could
                          fuck him over.
                               A hedonist within reason, Thomas knows he has to be careful lest the Beast leads him too
                          far down the dangerous path he’s trying to walk. That’s why the idea of drinking from blood
                          bags attracts him, even though his experience with them has, so far, been decidedly lackluster.
                          Innately curious about combining drugs and blood, Thomas keeps a helpful spreadsheet of all
                          his experiments with drinking from drugged-up mortals.
                          THINGS TO DO AS THOMAS:
                          • Seek out new sensations, weighing the pros and cons before diving in.
                          • Touch, handle, or poke around something you shouldn’t.
                          • Accidentally share everything you know about a subject because you’re too excited to keep it in.

    A TASTE OF THE MOON




                            GARNET GRIER
                          Keywords: Funny, Insightful, Chaotic, Vengeful
                               Garnet Grier was Embraced at a concert the night she made up her mind that she was
                          leaving law for comedy. This is a fact she finds deeply amusing. Garnet does her best to find the
                          humor in death, and nothing is more absurd to her than knowing her sire Embraced her for her
                          Rubenesque beauty… which appeared to them as they fell into the acid trip hiding in her blood.
                               When her sire left the Camarilla, Garnet followed with a sigh of relief. Existing among
                          them always felt like one wrong step would bring everything crashing down around her,
                          and honestly, that was too much pressure. Naturally gifted with a quick wit and writing
                          prowess, sometimes Garnet wishes she could take her routines outside of Kindred clubs where
                          entertaining monsters is a drag. So many ancillae can’t take a joke.
                          THINGS TO DO AS GARNET:
                          • Distract an enemy with a joke and if they don’t laugh, rip them apart because they
                            disrespected your brilliant timing.
                          • Find the humor in even the bleakest of situations.
                          • Convince someone powerful to laugh at themselves.
