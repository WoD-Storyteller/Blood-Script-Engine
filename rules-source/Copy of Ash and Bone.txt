                                                             It’s a mistake to think of vampires as simple
                                                          parasites that latch on to an unlucky victim and
                                                          drain them until they drop. No, they’re not ticks.
                                                             They’re spiders.
                                                             Kindred lure victims into their webs and
                                                          form a ring of protection and sustenance around
                                                          themselves. And spiders, like vampires, are cun-
                                                          ning. They ensnare the small and the weak, but
                                                          some bind the strong and the mighty.
                                                              Think of the spider when you consider the
                                                          vampire’s herd, the vampire’s retainers, the vam-
                                                          pire’s allies. They’re all theirs, caught in a web
                                                          surrounding a predator. Some even fool them-
                                                          selves into thinking they want to be there. They
                                                          think that proximity to the predator is a boon, or
                                                          maybe, just maybe, the predator will see them as
                                                          a creature with a use greater than sustenance.
                                                             Do not fall for the lies of the vampire, recruit.
                                                          Throughout their webs are trails of ash and bone,
                                                          from all their friends, loved ones, companions,
                                                          and cultists.
                                                              The vampire cannot help but be the hungry
                                                          spider.

                                                          Trails of Ash and Bone includes:

            hiding her face in her sleeve. Simón and Isabel refuse to speak
            to the player characters the rest of that night and no longer
            provide them with blood. The three cult members turn their
            backs to the player characters for the remainder of the story.


            The Box
                 During the daytime, the cult carries on with daily tasks
            and rituals, including (in the case of Villy), their own law
            and punishment system.
                 As the player characters wakes up after their day of sleep,
            they may notice Villy is missing. If they ask after his where-
            abouts, none of them answers and they deflect questions
            (unless Maria and her children were befriended during the
            day). A successful Manipulation + Persuasion roll (Difficulty
            2) makes one of the cult members reveal Villy has been sent
            to “the box.” The cultists judge each member’s effectiveness
            throughout the week, and if a cultist didn’t aid the family
            in a worthwhile way, they’re sent to the isolation box. This
            punishment is of Jakob’s devising, as he never wanted the
            Wellspring to form close enough bonds to realize they had no
            need of him. Villy voiced this belief on many occasions and
            was consistently shouted down by his fellow cultists.

            Convincing the Cult
                  The player characters, if Villy’s internment pricks their
            consciences, might attempt to convince the cultists that the
            old man needs to be let out. They must convince a majority
            of the members before they are successful, and this can be
            done with a successful Charisma + Persuasion (Difficulty 4)
            or Charisma + Performance (Difficulty 2) if one of them can
            take on the role of preacher or emotional orator. If success-
            ful, the cult lets out a parched but alive Villy.

            Forcing the Cult
                 A physical exchange with the cult might be the first in-
            stinct for the coterie, if they formed any kind of attachment
            to Villy. The cultists are scared of any such conflict, though
            if Søren remains present, he fights back as only a starving
            ghoul might, sickle in hand. He has little hope of harming
            them in an effective manner, but he feels increasingly like
            his leadership is being undermined.
                 Force might seem like the easiest way to rescue Villy,
            but it creates doubt in the cultists’ minds and makes them
            reconsider if the player characters are truly their new
            leaders. From now on, it is more difficult for the player
            characters to talk to the cultists and obtain information out
            of them, increasing the Difficulty of such attempts by 1. The
            box needs a successful Strength + Brawl roll (Difficulty 3) to
            have its locks broken.

    TRAILS OF ASH AND BONE




               C A I N E ’ S E LE VE N
               Some players are going to wonder aloud how easily they could rob a casino. It’ll happen, don’t worry. While this story
               isn’t built around a heist, using Disciplines to hypnotize or otherwise influence a croupier, evade cameras, or sneak
               their way into a cash room, is possible. Notably, however, difficulties to bypass security and stay hidden while carrying
               bags of cash are high (consider 5s or higher), as casinos are built like secure bank vaults, with multiple layers between
               gamblers and great quantities of cash, with dozens of eyes on the floor, the croupiers, the pit bosses, and the floor
               managers, all looking for something amiss.
               This doesn’t mean it can’t be done, but raiding a casino should be a major plot rather than a petty theft, and the
               prospect of grand larceny is bound to draw the attention of mortal law enforcement. Stealing from a casino where
               vampires are present and influential is equivalent to stealing a Prince’s blood dolls and Touchstones: you don’t make a
               haven in a casino unless you care a great deal about the money passing through it. Like blood, it’s sacred, and inviolate.
               Disrupting the flow draws attention and insults the host, and in Atlantic City, the host of the Three Bears — whether
               the player characters know it or not — is Edith Blumenau.
               AC contains several casinos, and while this story doesn’t pretend every casino is influenced by one or more vampires,
               it can be assumed any of the Kindred mentioned in the Atlantic City Kindred section (see p. 53) have stakes in these
               lucrative pies.

               From both Strand and Lubango, the player characters might hear of Lilith and the Bahari. Researching the two from
               a mortal perspective, at Atlantic City Free Public Library (which stays open until 23:00 for students on some nights)
               requires an easy Intelligence + Academics or Investigation roll to find out Lilith is a character from Jewish mythology,
               appearing in the Babylonian Talmud as Adam’s first wife. Any information the players can find online is equivalent to
               what the library contains.
               Researching the Bahari from a Kindred perspective requires pulling on the characters’ Mawla (or equivalent, appro-
               priate Backgrounds), or making an Intelligence + Occult roll (Difficulty variable depending on information given) if
               they might have heard of the cult before now. Difficulty 2 reveals they learn the Bahari are a predominantly non-male
               cult dedicated to change and rebirth, but with no centralized authority. Difficulty 3 reveals some Bahari believe in
               change through growth and cultivation, others through masochism and scourging historic sins from the body and
               spirit. Difficulty 4 reveals the Bahari aren’t fundamentally at odds with the Hecata, as many Lamiae are technically
               members of the clan and the cult. Difficulty 5 and higher highlights the cult’s practices and strongholds, as detailed
               in Cults of the Blood Gods.

               At this point of the story, it’s unlikely any men in the coterie are going to get into Luxemburg House without difficulty
               or use of Disciplines, so what’s the Storyteller to do if the coterie splits up or entirely consists of men?
               A split coterie should have any of the locked-out vampires having to deal with Lubango, the Anarch coterie, or Jay
               “Sideface” (see Blumenau Cauterizes, p. 85). Essentially, one half of the group deals with the social concerns within
               Luxemburg House while the half outside the center must evade capture or slaughter.
               A wholly male coterie needs to approach this scene differently. If they don’t find a way inside the center and to Or-
               nella Giovanni, a staff member from the center such as the matron, Hattie Williams, might leave the building on an
               errand, where she can be questioned or influenced with Disciplines. The center staff are a caring group, and could be
               duped into opening their doors if they saw someone in distress outside (though they’d also call for the police or an
               ambulance, if they saw something violent).
               Crucially, Ornella Giovanni does not leave the center under any circumstances. Neither Luxemburg House’s staff or
               tenants, nor the Bahari, are inclined to just give themselves to their persecutors. For all they know, that’s exactly what
               the player characters are.

            ham and the Kindred feared that worse was to come.
            Jeremiah offered something badly needed: he gave the
            vampires of Birmingham hope that they could change,
            and change the humans, keep Birmingham growing and
            flourishing.
                  To cut a long, sad story short, propelling the city
            into a new age turned out to be difficult so and Jeremiah
            grew disheartened. His failure weighed on him. He had
            no interest in running a city, but his laissez-faire rule has
            been good to the other clans: they’ve been able to scheme
            and maneuver and be the masters of their own destinies.
            It’s never been worth deposing him.
            PLOTS AND SCHEMES:
            •   Something Greater: Casaubon still harbors a vague
                desire to make Birmingham something greater than
                it currently is. He lacks the motivation, however, and
                it’s exceedingly difficult to stir any passion in him.

                    Greetings young Kindred,
                    The bearer of this letter awaits your reading and your reply, but please do not rush on his
               account. Let him enjoy these moments. He is quite fond of sherry. And destroy this letter
               upon reading it, won’t you? I adore my penmanship as much as anyone, and it seems a
               waste to lose such an artifact as this, yet we’ve a precious Masquerade to worry about, don’t
               we?
                    You must know the lay of the land, insofar as our broader kin are concerned. An in-
               depth exploration of our history is something you must arrange yourself, but I grant you the
               broadest of brushstrokes.
                    Let us begin at 1000 CE, just about the start of the Golden Age of Florentine art. This
               was also the beginning of a long-standing alliance between the, well, you would call them
               the Toreador and Lasombra. Neither of those are the best monikers claimed by either clan.
               But who am I to play the part of rigid prescriptivist, eh? Whatever our names, we joined in a
               marriage of machinations at the same time as that great flourishing of our beloved city state.
               Coincidence? I’ll leave you to draw your own conclusions.
                    In 1164, Prince Alanus fell to an assassin. Thus, began the Century of Two Princes.
               From 1164 to 1258 two rival Princes — Anicius the Golden and Panfilio the Cruel, each
               of Clan Lasombra — maneuvered for supremacy. What a grand game that was. In the end,
               Anicius, my great-grandsire claimed praxis.
                    From there, we enjoyed a time of greatness and plenty that persisted nearly eight hun-
               dred years. That isn’t to say it was a time of stability. The political landscape was tempes-
               tuous, but that is the preferred landscape of my clan. It was a paradise of whispered words,
               weaponized letters, daggers, wordplay at the highest stakes. I could speak of the rise of the
               Medici, but that is such a tangled knot. You would benefit more from my scrivening of rise of
               the Hecata.
                    Let us look to the year 1916. That was the year a preternatural phenomenon raged
               across the Underworld. Ghost unfettered and twisted conquered the government of the dead in
               Florence and surged into the lands of the living.
                    Strange nights. Imagine an elder, a being of such might, flailing uselessly at invisibles.
               Imagine vomiting up a whole night’s worth of fine hunting upon the tufted carpet, and that
               boiling, clotted mess rising to attack. Imagine the sun is coming up, and so you make your
               way to your coffin or darkened room, only to find the short hallway is endless. Many of our
               kind learned what it is to be afraid of the dark.
                    Enter the Giovanni. Our heroes! Understand, the Giovanni had been a fixture of power
                  in Florence for centuries, but they knew their place. The Florentine Giovanni learned




                                                                        132

              their lessons from the Medici well — to make oneself indispensable, to expertly invest
              one’s efforts and resources, and to eventually eclipse those for whom one serves.
                   The Giovanni had always been useful and welcome, but as of 1916, they were indispensa-
              ble. They did not overcharge. They did not take advantage. They helped us. My predecessors
              handed the Giovanni more positions, more duties, more power. They leaned on the necroman-
              cers more and more. My predecessors became lazy, fattened ticks, and so they popped.
                   The decades proceeded like this. More graverobbers entered the city, but these were not
              Giovanni. Then came this “Reunion” and they were all Hecata. Then they claimed power.
                   I cannot say the night or even the year it happened exactly. There was no moment of
              transition. We were the proverbial frog in the pan, the water heating so gradually that it
              does not know it is cooking until it is cooked. They seeded their power so slowly. The coaxed
              our reliance on them so subtly. There was no violent coup. There was no public proclamation.
              One night we all looked up, and all we saw were Hecata. So many of them! There were no
              words, only meaningful looks that spoke hideous volumes.
                   The Hecata achieved praxis by imperceptible degrees. I can only applaud until my hands
              bleed. And though things are not as bad as 1916, the wraiths are restless again, and again
              we rely on the necromancers. Yet how does such a collection of ancient enemies become a fami-
              ly? Carmen Giovanni, now the nominal head of his family in Florence, welcomes all of the
              more … provincial bloodlines with open arms. They seem to hold their cousins in line with this
              policy, though there was an exception. Emmanuel Giovanni, elder brother of Carmen in life,
              raged against the coming together of the Clan of Death. I am told that Carmen locked their
              brother in the Brazen Bull and roasted him, a sacrifice of their own higher blood to prove to
              the other graverobbing bloodlines of their seriousness. Do I sound impressed? Carmen is my
              rival, true, but I can afford a modicum of respect for such a masterstroke.
                   Florence still welcomes the Camarilla. I myself hold a seat on the city’s council. Yes, all
              Lasombra here are of the Camarilla. To be fair, we never did fit in with Gratiano’s miscre-
              ants. The Florentine Shadows do not have to leap through the same flaming hoops that our
              siblings in other Camarilla cities are reputed to have. The Camarilla needs us. We are the
              instrument of retaking beloved Florence.
                   The Hecata are a grand triumph of a tapestry, but they cannot endure. They have too
              many frayed ends. They are a maladjusted family. We are an institution. It is right that we
              should rule, and the opportunity to rule will present itself. I bide my time. I make myself
              indispensable.
                   I have arranged your attendance to an upcoming masked ball, where you can meet the
              most important Kindred of this city. Consider the price a minor boon.
                   Until next time, I remain, as ever,
                   Rinaldo Albizzi

                   P.S. Give the bearer of this letter another sherry and then kill him. He’s been whisper-
              ing in Carmen’s ear. I can trust my seal found you unbroken and my letter unread. He is a
              betrayer, true — and so bound for the Ninth Circle of Hell, according to our most famous poet
              — but some things are simply not done. Consider your boon repaid.

              HANDOUT #1: LETTER FROM CARMEN GIOVANNI

                   Greetings,
                   Good evening to you in this beautiful city of memory immemorial. Tomor-
                row evening, I shall host a masked ball of ineffable magnificence in celebra-
                tion of my great family coming together. I ravenously desire your attendance.
                I know! An invitation sent so last minute is unforgiveable. I blush. I burn!
                Yet I have no doubts you will grant me maximum reconciliation. Do not fail
                to witness the delights I have in store. Come costumed in whatever mad motley
                tickles your soul. Come to the Palazzo Pitti. My people will find you and show
                you into our private revels.
                   Illimitably yours,

                  Situated on the south side of the River Arno,
            the Palazzo Pitti is a vast Renaissance palace. The
            core of the present palazzo dates from 1458. The
            Medici family purchased the palace in 1549, and it
            became the chief residence of the ruling families of
            the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The Giovanni have
            held shadowy dominion over the palace for centu-
            ries, helping to turn it into a treasure house, amass-
            ing paintings, luxury items, and occulted artifacts
            not seen by the public at large. In modern nights,
            the palazzo serves as the largest museum complex in
            Florence.
                  Should the player character consult any other
            Kindred on their last-minute invitation to the
            Hecata’s masked ball, they may learn any of the
            following:
            •   The vampires of Florence in general, and the
                Giovanni in particular, are renowned for
                throwing magnificent parties.

            •   Elysium at these celebrations is fiercely pro-
                tected, even across sect lines. The Florentine
                Kindred take a certain glee in hosting contro-
                versial figures safely (at least while within the
                walls of their parties).

            •   The Camarilla regularly attends these affairs.
                The head of the Camarilla in Florence is a
                Lasombra.

            •   Clan Hecata is using this masked ball to cele-
                brate their reunion.

            •   Receiving a direct invitation from Carmen
                Giovanni is a great honor. Attending such an
                event is a good way to form ties to the most
                powerful Kindred of the city.
                 On the night of the masquerade, when the
            coterie approaches the palazzo, a servant of the
            Giovanni recognizes them on sight and approaches
            in an authentic Renaissance costume (much to the
            delight of passing tourists). The ghoul says, “You are
            expected. Our most gracious host welcomes you. I
            will show you to the revels.”



                                                                      141

               Once the coterie receives the Autonomy of the Grave, the Hecata become willing, even eager, to lay all of their
               skeleton-filled cupboards bare. From this point on, the necromancers open their secrets to the characters. This is an
               excellent opportunity for a Storyteller to showcase bits of deep lore not normally known by neonates. Such secrets
               could include, but are not limited to:
               •     The upcoming expiration of the Promise (see Cults of the Blood Gods, p. 126).
               •     The disappearance or death of Augustus Giovanni (see Cults of the Blood Gods, p. 129).
               •     The Endless Night, Augustus’s grand plan to tear down the Shroud (see Cults of the Blood Gods, p. 147).
               •     Fundamentals, practices, and secrets of necromancy and Oblivion (see Cults of the Blood Gods, p. 203).
               •     Secret histories of Florence, the Kindred who live there, and the way the Hecata operate in the city (to be de-
                     termined by the Storyteller).
               At first, the characters might be quite keen to have this backstage pass to chthonic knowledge. However, a sense of
               foreboding should slowly bleed into that excitement. Much like the rising tension in the film Midsommar, the coterie
               should come to a paranoid conclusion: “Oh no … they’re showing us too much!”
               To better complete their task, the more they must delve into the secrets of these ancient death cults. The more they
               learn, the less likely they will be allowed to leave. All of the Florentine Kindred are so polite and cooperative. How does
               one extricate themselves from such a pleasant trap?
               The horror arrives with the realization that there is a point of no return and deepens with the further realization that
               there is no way to know where that point exists. This dread is particularly poignant for non-Hecata characters, but
               even Hecata neonates realize they are learning too much too quickly.




                                                                            146

            Refusing the meal adds a +1 difficulty
            to all social rolls with Ravinder or the
            other Hecata in attendance.
                 Soon, there is nothing left of the
            quivering mass.
            PLEASURE ROOM
                  Passing by a half open door, the
            characters hear the orgiastic sounds of
            pleasure, from perhaps a dozen people.
            However, if they look in the room,
            there are only well-preserved cadavers
            laying on tables. Alternatively, there is
            a single Hecata Kindred, in the room
            full of bodies, who looks up at the
            interruption and smiles.
            THE BRAZEN BULL
                  One room contains a full-sized
            bronze statue of a bull. Carmen Gio-
            vanni stands before the bull, admiring
            it. They explain that this is a one-of-
            a-kind artifact, a deadly device from
            millennia ago. A person was locked
            inside the bull, and a fire was started
            beneath its metal belly, cooking the
            poor wretch. Through genius acoustics,
            the mouth and nostrils converted the
            screams of the victim into the trum-
            peting sound of a bull’s bellow.
                  “The bull carries a powerful
            resonance, helpful to certain rituals,
            but it also gave me an idea.”
                  Carmen pulls out a mask with
            a mouthpiece, explaining how they
            designed it to convert the screams of
            a vessel into a musical sound.
                  “Would you like a demonstra-
            tion?”
                  If the player says yes, Carmen

                If, during the masked ball, the coterie did not play out the encounter with Rinaldo Albizzi, where he pointed out the
                portraits of two ancient Lasombra Princes of Florence (see “Of Princes Past” in Canto I, p. 140), have Carmen looking
                at these two portraits as the coterie enters this scene. They can offer the same history and commentary, giving the
                characters another opportunity to recognize the faces of the long-dead Princes when they encounter the Hungry
                Gestalt.
                If none of the characters belong to the Camarilla, then they did not receive a letter from Rinaldo Albizzi as part of
                their starting handouts (see “A Kindred History,” p. 132). In this case, when the characters enter this scene, Carmen
                holds a copy of the letter. They hand it to one of the characters, saying, “This was in the pocket of a little Ivory Tower
                neonate who attended my party last night. Tell me what you make of it.”
                Carmen allows anyone in the coterie to read the letter and awaits their reply, listening to their input with genuine
                interest. If asked what their own opinion is, they simply say, “Rinaldo does keep things interesting. His history is even
                reasonably accurate.” If asked about the fate of the Camarilla neonate in question, Carmen only laughs before leading
                the coterie into the Vasari Corridor.

    TRAILS OF ASH AND BONE




                                T H E RU BY T H ROAT
                 Atlantic City has a reputation to uphold, and for those
            who travel to the shore to toy with the fickle whims of lady
            luck, there’s no reason that death need stop the fun. Origi-
            nally established in the prohibition era as a member’s only
            roulette club by a popular boardwalk dancing girl, the Ruby
            Throat became a den of powerful people wagering far more
            than money. Rumor has it a well-known sea facing hotel was
            won over a single roll one night at the Ruby Throat.
                 During the Second World War, the location the Ruby
            Throat operated out of was retrofitted into a factory. The
            founder, now a rich woman well past her dancing years,
            planned to happily retire and allow the club to fade into
            the shadows. A local Kindred named Edith Blumenau
            loved both her and the marvelous club she had built far
            too much to allow either to leave the city, and made both
            a permanent fixture of the boardwalk.
                 Note: The Ruby Throat is easily moved to any other city
            with a history of gambling or organized crime, and switches
            locations from opulent sites to flea-bitten dens.

            Known by many names throughout history, the shadowy

            lifetimes studying and honing an intimate understanding

    TRAILS OF ASH AND BONE




                               RELICS OF THE V EIL
                 When mortals speak of haunted rooms, of places
            where temperature drops and whispers tickle the senses,
            they are often unknowingly in the presence of a powerful
            fetter or relic connected closely to the realms of the dead.
                 In the hands of mortals or Kindred without the
            proper understanding, relics connecting those in the
            world of the living to those beyond the veil provide
            nothing more than a feeling of unease, but in the right
            hands they can be powerful talismans assisting those
            who deal in the power of Oblivion. Strange objects, some
            found in passing, some passed down through families and
            bloodlines over centuries, each one is connected somehow
            to the world beyond the veil, and brings with them the
            attentions of wraiths and other entities.

                  Holly blamed herself for not keeping her family to-
            gether, and she ran away from home. School records were
            all missing, and when Holly lost interest and stopped
            attending at 14, no-one came looking for her. As the city
            trudged on resolutely, Holly thought there was no proof
            left she ever existed at all. She would spend the next few
            years of her life on the streets of the city, living in various
            homes, making transient friends among street kids and
            the homeless, always feeling directionless. She saw the
            brutal treatment of the people who lived on the street —
            she would inevitably end up blaming herself when one
            became the victim of police brutality or the cruelty of
            tourists.

            of her city was the music found there on the street. She
            began picking up guitar and soon showed a clear aptitude
            for it. She’d play on the street, with old jazz musicians,
            living on tossed coins, and soon found a stage to play on
            at an old basement bar owned by a friend of her father’s.

            a safe place to sleep when times were rough. People came                play the enigma. She is perceptive but simultaneously ab-

              Conviction: Ratkyd doesn’t steal from those who
              help people. Social workers, teachers, paramedics, all
              these are callings that Ratkyd respects, and keeps their
              hands out of the pockets of. In fact, Ratkyd stands up
              for them, hurting those who hurt them.
              Touchstones: Ratkyd was always bad at taking advice
              or accepting help, but they noticed when people made
              the effort. Unlike the parents that never seemed to
              give a damn, Mr. MacGowan was a math teacher who
              asked Ratkyd how they were doing, offered to lend an
              ear, and had words of advice. Even though it wasn’t his
              job, he actually cared. Ratkyd likes to drop in and see
              how the old math teacher is doing now and then.

            MORTAL DAYS: LIFE IS STRANGE
                 Alek was a weird kid, and when his parents found a
            box of animal bones from the local woods hidden under
            his bed, they were concerned they were raising a psycho-
            path. After time spent with a child psychologist though,
            they were assured the boy just had an advanced interest
            in the way things work. Just like building blocks, the boy
            wanted to take things apart and put them back together.
            He obsessed with books about the human body, and as he
            grew older, explored a multitude of medical conditions
            and indulged in a little amateur taxidermy.
                 Going into the medical field was not Alek’s original
            dream. He saw death in almost a more artistic light than
            in a physical one. He loved the way bones fit together,
            the way muscles move, and flesh stretches. He didn’t have

    TRAILS OF ASH AND BONE




              Predator: Alleycat
              Embraced: 2015 (Born 1988)
              Ambition: Matt loves working with the family. It
              makes him proud, and he wants his family to be the
              best. To become a made man that any Kindred feels
              confident to work with — that’s what Matt seeks.
              Suggested Desire: Prove to himself and to his new
              family that he’s capable and consistent with his hands-
              on work.
              Conviction: While he’s fine with implicating rivals and
              others within crime rings, Matt would never snitch or
              inform on anyone in the family to higher authority.
              Touchstones: Two of Matt’s elder brothers are in the
              crime game and are even being looked at for possible
              ghouls should they exceed themselves. The remaining
              brother is the smart one, their mother always joked.
              A simple family man with the wife and kids that Matt
              never got, Matt likes to take time to see his brother
              and live a little moment of the normal life.                      they looked out for one another, and knew that family
