                                                  London 2012. Mithras, god among vampires, returns from
                                                  diablerie at the fangs of Montgomery Coven. The Heralds
                                                of the Sun awaken from torpor unable to remember who they
                                                  are, but driven to seek five artifacts to restore their master
                                                     to his full glory. The Second Inquisition rises to burn
                                                                    London’s Kindred to ashes.

                                                                           What legacy will you leave?

                                                  The Fall of London chronicle, for Vampire: The Masquerade, embroils
                                                 you in Kindred history as it unfolds. Your actions might see a god return,
                                                 or cast him down from whence he came. London burns under Operation
                                                          Antigen, as you uncover the shards of your own identity.

                                              Requires the Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition rulebook to play.

                          This is a work of speculative horror fiction, set in a dark reflection of our own world. Thus it contains
                           graphic depictions of sex, blood-drinking, drugs, violence, abuse, political oppression, coercion, occult-
                          ism, heresy and many other potentially upsetting themes. Recommended for mature readers and play-
                           ers. For advice on considerate play and how to handle sensitive themes in tabletop roleplaying games,
                         see the section "Considerate play" in the PDF version of the Vampire: The Masquerade rulebook.

            The Rise, Fall,
            and Return of Mithras
            Any story of London must begin with Mithras, the
            legendary Ventrue methuselah who claimed London as
            his domain for close to two millennia. Mithras came to
            Britain in the 1st century CE with the invasion force led
            by general Aulus Plautius under Emperor Claudius, and
            quickly established the Roman province of Britannia as
            his own private domain. Although over the following
            centuries Mithras continued to travel widely, he always
            named Londinium as his home, and he would suffer no
            contest over this territory. Other Kindred could dwell in
            Britain, but only if they accepted his authority.
                Mithras established the Blood Laws for his Kindred
            subjects long before the Camarilla’s formation, and in
            fact many believe these were appropriated by the Ca-

            have often aligned with it.                                        operated alone. Mithras designed the cells so

            Scene Three: Bhangra and Lassi
            Maybe the characters don’t go to the library first, or maybe they need to
            pass some time before Thursday’s scheduled meeting. A Wits + Medicine
            or Occult, Difficulty 4, alerts them to a Duskborn entering the Roti Mojo
            if the Threat Level is 2 or lower. Alternately, Ferhat in Scene Two may
            have talked about the Roti Mojo and Najma. If the Operation Antigen
            Threat Level is 3 or above, they easily see the recently closed and cordoned
            off fast food joint – any local can tell the characters this is due to a recent
            police raid which found an alarming quantity of drugs on the premises.


            Hanging with the Duskborn
            The local Duskborn react with some hostility to any who are recognizable as
            Kindred. Several of the thin-bloods will be prepared to bargain information
            in exchange for influence, resources, or Kindred blood. All the thin-bloods
            know Sri Sansa considers himself the boss lick round these parts. They don’t
            think he has much to do with any vampire sect, though their knowledge of
            these sects and the differences between them is shaky. They know Sri Sansa
            hangs out in the library where he has a mortal cult who protects him like
            fanatics. They are clear he is not welcome in the Roti Mojo, so the characters
            will not meet with him there. They can learn he sometimes entertains in an
            upper room of the Subtle Spice. Here the characters may also learn the Blue

                     Here are some things the family might say:

                ■   “What a time for a move! Dear Sri is a night owl, but
                    this late at night?”

                thing to attract his attention or simply because Sri looks
                over in their direction, Sri makes eye contact and, in

                 Sri Sansa turns and looks at the scene. His Hun-

            mortals present do nothing to help initially, though
            some are busily looting the victims’ property. The
            driver is too busy with his injured horses to fight
            the looters off.
                 If the characters choose to stop the looting, they
            can roll Charisma + Persuasion or Intimidate at
            Difficulty 5. This would please the carriage driver who
            would then be inclined to help the characters for the
            rest of the scene.
                 If they decide to render medical assistance, the
            elderly lady requires Dexterity + Medicine test at
            Difficulty 7 to stabilize. Without immediate aid, her
            injuries prove fatal. Staunching the flow of blood and
            setting the gentleman’s leg is easier at Difficulty 4.
            An Intelligence + Medicine test at Difficulty 3 reveals
            the younger woman is suffering clinical shock. Even
            without a diagnosis, a warm coat and some kind
            words will help to restore her, prompting her to in-
            troduce herself as Nichole McGrann, though further
            treatment will be needed to ensure her full recovery.
            Alternatively, if they lack medical skills, the charac-
            ters could send a nearby urchin to run for a doctor,
            which they do for coin or a trinket, or for free if they
            were kind to Emmy earlier.
                 This too is a feeding opportunity. The old woman
            is going to die anyway, and the chap will probably die

            person’s’ club in the London Under-
            ground. The thing is, I’ve been walking
            around here for nights, and I can’t
            really find any club or any people.”

            How did you get past the guards?
            “That’s the thing, I can’t. See, when
            I went down here a couple of nights
            ago, the station was yet to be closed.
            And now, I can’t get out again since
            there are police 24/7 all over the damn
            place, making it impossible for me to
            get anywhere. They’ll probably think I
            am some sort of terrorist if I suddenly
            emerge from the darkness two nights
            after they closed the station.”

            Are you of the blood?
            “Do you mean … a vampire? Well, yes.
            I am. Very recently as well. I don’t
            know much about this whole ordeal,
            all I know is rat blood tastes like what
            they eat – trash.”

            Have you seen anyone else down
            here?
            “You know, I want to say no and yes.
            No, because I haven’t really inter-
            acted with anyone at all besides you
            these last nights. Yes... Because I feel
            watched. I don’t know if this is my
            lack of food making me delirious or
            there is actually someone down here.

   FALL OF LONDON




                tigation test at Difficulty 3 lets the characters spot
                an article detailing a large part of the London under-
                ground threatening to close because of safety concerns.
                The article mentions tube travelers going missing or
                returning home disoriented, and similar issues with
                visitors taking tours of the deep level shelter tunnels.
                The article continues that the problem set on quite
                suddenly, with Londoners blaming everything from
                underground monsters to a gas leak. It finishes up with
                various authorities, including a council member, pro-
                posing to close the tunnels permanently due to these
                safety hazards.

                RATS
                A few rats are all running across the floor in the same
                direction. If the coterie follows the rats, they see eight
                of them attacking one of their own, ripping out intes-
                tines and pieces of muscle from the bone. An Intelli-
                gence + Animal Ken test at Difficulty 3 reveals several
                rats, including the rat the others are eating, have
                visible fang-marks covering its body – in an effort to
                maintain the rat population in his liar, de Worde tries
                not to kill any rats when he feeds from them.
                    The coterie also notices several mini bags of chips,
                cookies, granola bars, and bottles of water cut in half,
                placed around the control center as if someone is
                trying to feed the rats. The food is clearly taken from
                vending machines around the Underground. This is
                also de Worde’s attempt to keep the rats.

                DE WORDE’S FILES
                An old safe stands in the left end of the room, hidden
                beneath an old linen sheet. The coterie can open the
                safe by force, with a Strength + Athletics at Difficulty
                7. It can also be opened with a Wits + Larceny test at
                Difficulty 5.
                     Inside are brown paper folders labelled “The
                Heralds.” When opened, several pages fall from the
                folder, detailing the characters’ clans, their regular
                habits, the name of any contacts and Touchstones,
                feeding preferences referring to 1940, when they are
                usually out for the night, and several details about
                their pre-torpor existence as the Storyteller sees fit.
                The folder also holds pictures of the characters taken
                from hidden angles tucked away in the files, and

            Although the London Underground claims it has 300

                after the Web retreated, reveals both the Web of
                Hunger’s workings, and that her ring served to
                counter the effect. This information should prove
                invaluable to Clan Nosferatu, as its members have
                been struggling to keep their hunger at bay too –
                Richard had no regard for any clan mates crossing
                his territory when he cast his spell.
            ■   If the characters reveal this later, the Storyteller
                should forego all further checks and boons to gain
                information from Clan Nosferatu – for the dura-

                in Sunset of Flames starts the following night.
            ■   If they saved Victor, his sire Sanaya Gadhi can
                arrange a meeting with Regina Blake in Red Lists
                and Red Caps.
            ■   If the characters met with Gabriella and accepted
                her phone number, the enterprising Nosferatu can
                point them to Southall in Family Affairs, or Daria

   FALL OF LONDON




          “Will you serve
          POWER,
             or rise to
                 fight it?”
                     Arwyn is in a good mood if
                the coterie succeeded as she has
                an Alastor contact who keeps her
                informed of her status. She hands
                over the Phrygian cap and grandly
                promises the coterie a Boon.
                     If the coterie failed to remove
                Arwyn from consideration for the
                Red List, they can try a Charisma +
                Persuasion roll opposed by Resolve
                + Insight to still get the Phrygian
                cap from her. If they fail this roll,
                but Chun Hei is still at Arwyn’s
                side, the ancient Brujah lets them
                leave freely and with little ill will.
                If they fail the roll and previously
                destroyed Chun Hei, the Brujah
                flies into a rage and attacks. Unless
                the coterie contains the fight to the
                backroom, the ensuing Masquerade
                breach sees Antigen agents arrive
                in four rounds.
                     The characters can also lie,
                though Arwyn is suspicious as her
                Alastor contact hasn’t called her.
                This requires a Manipulation +
                Subterfuge roll opposed by Resolve
                + Insight. If the roll fails, Arwyn
                narrows her eyes and threatens to
                “meet” the coterie later.
                     As a last resort, the coterie
                could send Operation Antigen
                into the Vaults and retrieve the
                Phrygian cap when the dust dies
                down. This does earn them a spot
                on the Red List should anyone
                find out.

                                        Najma Elmi
                                        Najma survived the Fall of London, collecting most remaining thin-
                                        bloods under her rule. Together they pose a formidable front, and have
                                        claimed praxis of Southall.


                                        Oskar Anasov
                                        Ever the survivor, Oskar’s knowledge of spy craft has helped him evade
                                        capture, and he now maintains the local Kindred communication network
                                        by carrier pigeon. He is also a reliable contact for getting other Kindred
                                        safely out of the city – for a price.


                                        Rowena
                                        The Irish Gangrel warrior survived the purge of London’s Kindred and now
                                        keeps to the Barrens. She has struck up an uneasy truce with some local
                                        lupines, who have been similarly targeted by hunters recently. She and her
                                        allies want nothing to do with Kindred politics, but could be useful in any
                                        future fight against the agents of Operation Antigen.

                                        search, and holds some hope that Blake may be safely found some night.

                                        Z survived in the Nosferatu’s hidden underground, and has even managed to
                                        rise to some importance as courier ferrying messages between Landlords.


                                        The King of Shadows
                                        Rumor has it they ruled London’s darkest places even before the fall of
                                        Queen Anne’s court. If Richard de Worde survived his encounter with the
                                        coterie, this might be him. Otherwise, it must be another Nosferatu now
                                        claiming the underground tunnel network of the city center as their own.
                                        Cleverly working through what seems like a legion of proxies and servants,
                                        few have ever met this self-proclaimed king. They claim no allegiance to
                                        the Camarilla or any other sect, and have little concerns outside of the city
                                        itself. Although commonly thought to be a Nosferatu, nobody really knows
                                        for sure. In fact, if the coterie chose to rule London together, the characters
                                        might be sharing the mask of the King of Shadows ■

                A murder will be escalated to the Met’s Homicide Command, who will
            assign the investigation to a Murder Investigation Team (MIT) within the
            relevant regional unit. The Directorate of Forensic Services will investigate
            any crime scene, and any bodies will be sent to the nearest Coroner’s office.
                Other violent crimes may involve personnel from the Met’s Robbery
            Unit SCD7 (also ‘Flying Squad’ or ‘Sweeney’), the Counter-Terrorism
            Command Unit SO15, or the Specialist Firearms Command Unit CO19.
            Internal investigations of corruption and malpractice within the Met are
            handled by the Directorate of Professional Standard (DPS). All the Met’s
            specialist directorates and subdivisions are headquartered at the Met’s
            New Scotland Yard complex situated in Westminster.
                Violent crime is taken very seriously by the authorities. Although
            guns are restricted and not easily obtained by civilians, between 2,000            ADAPTING THE MET
            and 3,000 incidents involving firearms are logged by the Met every year.           TO YOUR CHRONICLE
            The Met’s own statistics show that in 75% of cases a gun is used to intim-         The infrastructure and

            matic or semi-automatic weapon is explicitly prohibited. Firearms appli-           response to external over-

                Due to the many difficulties relating to gun ownership, violent crimes         in the modern nights or in
            using blunt and bladed weapons are on the rise. Notably in juvenile gangs          other time periods, please

            convicted of holding such a weapon can lead to fines and a prison sentence
            of up to 4 years.
                Organised crime is a huge problem for us. The Met is tracking thou-
            sands of different crime organizations operating in the city, many of which
            originate from overseas. Commonplace activities include robbery, rack-
            eteering, drug distribution, human trafficking, gun smuggling, illegal sex
            work, and money laundering. Many operate with cell structures that make
            it difficult to map the larger organization. And for each cell we dismantle,
            another quickly rises to take its place. It’s an endless, thankless job, that is
            only going to get worse if the government’s policy of under-funding law
            enforcement agencies continues.

                                   COURT OF SHADOWS

            T
                         he King of Shadows is a mysterious figure
                         in London’s supernatural society. Variously
                         described as a vampire, a criminal kingpin, a
                         champion of the downtrodden, and a ghostly
            agent of retribution, few know the truth. The darkest and
            ugliest corners of London now belong to the King, and
            they suffer no insult, and brook no competition.
                 While the King is not known to foster friendships, they
            have many agents and allies that serve them across the city,
            both on the street and below it. These agents can be found
            everywhere: near train and tube stations, on street corners
            and bus stops, outside all-night convenience stores, in hos-
            tels, under bridges, and in other more downtrodden places.
                 Many mortals and Kindred alike are in the King’s debt,
            and those that are foolish enough to become their enemy are
            seldom seen for long. To be in the King’s favor is considered a         agents are never hungry, and never want for a roof over

                            peration Antigen is the name of the coalition of
                            police, military, and intelligence assets that purged the
                            city of London of organized vampire influence. Anti-
                            gen is still active tonight, in a second phase dedicated
            to ensuring that supernatural criminal influence does not return. The
            success of the operation has led to similar anti-vampire initiatives
            being sponsored in other cities in the United Kingdom and abroad.
                You carefully cultivated allies and contacts that give you
            some insight into Operation Antigen and its ongoing efforts in
            London, and to similar activities elsewhere. You may also be able
            to exert some limited influence over its night-to-night affairs, to
            better protect yourself and the ones you love, or to set them upon
            your enemies and rivals. These interactions do not come without
            risk, however, as no Kindred can be considered truly safe from
            Antigen’s reach.
