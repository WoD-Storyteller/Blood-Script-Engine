              S
                      ome of you call me the Martyr of Caine. It is one of the many appellations I have
                      worn in my thousand years as one of the undead.
                      I hope those one thousand years convince you of my bona fides. My position is not
                      an empty appeal to my own authority. My voice is the voice of one who has seen
              firsthand the tumult of ages. I myself lit fires and drank blood in Silchester when the
              Anarchs rebelled. I myself touched the faces of the Eldest, have worn shackles in its
              Cathedral.
              The world is ever-changing, and the Damned must change with it. The Sabbat must change
              with it. Centuries ago, our tools were blood and fire. Tonight, many of us continue to
              wage war with those same weapons. And the mortal world once took up fire against us in
              return.
              Tonight, we have had our backs broken by our sires and grandsires, our hearts pierced
              by mortal hunters — hunters who themselves know that wooden stakes and torches, while
              still effective, give way to more effective tools. Swarms of death-spitting homunculi
              that hover in the sky. Weapons that outpace the rending of life that even the hoary
              koldun can coax from the ground.
              The mortals have once again taken up fire. Our sires and grandsires likewise roar their
              fire against us. You have read the Book. You know the signs.
              Our blood and fire do not hold back the night. From our vantage, fire is inadequate
              to even illuminate the night for any true duration.
              Our dominion will not be realized by calling upon the same blood and fire we wielded
              against superstitious peasants as they shuddered on their crofts.
              Our dominion will not be realized by seizing domain and reclining on its throne, like a
              pasha, like a Camarilla crow.
              We shall realize our dominion not by lingering upon what we are, but by heeding what
              we must become.
              This Damned form — this Cainite form — is but a chrysalis. It is mutable, mere flesh,
              mere clay. We have left our mortal clay behind, but our journey does not end with these
              vile bodies.
              We must, then, ourselves become the night.
              We must become.
              For such is the will of Caine.

  Introduction




                 Introduction
                    We are each our own devil, and we make this world our hell.
                    ― OSCA R W I LDE




                 N
                              o sect evokes such fear at its mention, such revulsion at its ideologies,
                              as does the Sabbat. The self-styled Sword of Caine wages a war — a
                              war of ages, a holy war, a Gehenna War — against the legendary
                              progenitors of the clans, the Antediluvians. Citing the Book of Nod,
                 the Sabbat seeks to avenge the ancient betrayal of Caine by his wayward childer,
                 seeking nothing less than the destruction of the Antediluvians and the subjuga-
                 tion of the mortal world to a brutal hierarchy with vampires at its apex.
                     Other sects regard the Sabbat as heretical at best and apocalyptic at worst.
                 Some outright deny the existence of Antediluvians, proclaiming them myth, al-
                 legory, or centuries dead. Others regard them as torpid, far-distant, or irrelevant
                 in the modern nights.
                     That’s exactly what drives the fear other sects have of the Sabbat: Not only
                 do they prosecute a fanatical agenda, they do so with little regard for themselves,
                 and with the convictions of an era long past, a time of Long Night.

            Generation’s treachery.
                To that end, the traditional anathema of the
            undead, sunlight, has a diminished effect on thin-
            blooded Cainites. Followers of this Path see it as
            part of their mandate to turn this to their advan-
            tage, as they are able to meet the Dark Father’s
            threats during hours that normally see Cainites as
            having succumbed to the daysleep. Its followers
            are often easily recognized by the burn-scars and
            disfigurements they wear as badges of defiance and
            sufferance in Caine’s name.
                The Path of the Sun is an imperfect Path. It is
            very much unproven, more of an emergent outlook
            among those fighting at the forefront of the Ge-
            henna War, and practiced almost exclusively among
            the very youngest Sabbat. Indeed, it has only very

            as a rite of passage or as a punishment for failure.
            Using avian spies to avoid detection, they approach
            only what they perceive as weak or weakened prey.
            Desperate to gain recognition among their peers,

            Path of Cathari Radicalizer
            The Radicalizer is all about “The Movement.”
            Skirting the edges of an Anarch domain they at-
            tract vampires with a grudge: those who have lost
            something, or at least believe themselves to have
            lost something. The Radicalizer promises a reckon-
            ing and encourages the disenfranchised licks to act
            against their oppressors, to hurt them or those they
            care about. It’s all in the name of “The Movement”
            or “Your Rights as a Kindred.” Every lick deserves
            to be what Caine intended them to be, and damn
            anyone who tries to defang us!

            Notes: Thin-bloods treading the Path of the Sun
            usually work closely in large packs, though their
            methods are far more subtle than those of other
            Sabbat. Prometheans take pride in their ability
            to blend in and to rise above the crude vampiric
            stereotypes of the “cadavers” and hangarounds of
            Kindred clans or Cainite Paths. They are quick to
            proselytize to other thin-bloods, whether low-
            ranking Sabbat or marginal members of other sects,
            and the Path encourages a camaraderie that seems
            almost human – at least until they descend on a
            target’s haven like piranhas in Oakleys, minutes past
            dawn.

            Unbirthed
            Thin-bloods rarely last in the Black Hand. Too
            weak initially to survive the fierce crucible of
            Crusades, Path rivalries and the ongoing Gehenna
            War, they’re always among the first undead casual-
            ties. Nevertheless, Necronomist practitioners have
            managed to weaponize the phenomena. By per-
            forming a charnel ritual atop a mass grave, tearing
            a sacrificial fledgling asunder in the process, the
            buried are brought to a semblance of unlife as the
            vitae infuses their bodies. When the sun sets the
            crazed half-living cadavers dig themselves out, their
            decaying minds ravaged by Hunger, and descend
            upon anything living in the area. Lacking most
            self-preservation instincts, they rampage heedlessly
            until sunrise.                                               already dead bodies also accelerates the destruction

            prolonged suspension by hooks may also be
            employed by Devourers. All of the curses of
            Caine must be overcome through steadfast
            perseverance, unwavering faith and ultimately by
            complete submission to the Dark Father’s will.

            CONTRITION RITAE
            Devourers prefer to teach even with their punish-
            ments. While major transgressions that would
            demand final death are often settled through
            Monomacy, diablerie, or dismemberment, lesser
            crimes are often punished by echoing Caine’s trials
            in the land of Nod. Heated brands and crushing
            stones are common corrective implements among
            the Devourers.

            HUNTING RITAE
            Diablerie is an especially meaningful sacrament
            for those on the Path of Caine. Although the Book
            of Nod occasionally warns against drinking the
            heartsblood, Devourers often believe that covenant
            was broken when the Antediluvians rebelled against
            Caine’s will.
                Noddists seek the Blood of other vampires when
            they hunt, especially that of the thin-blooded,
            whom they see as heralds of the Antediluvians. Such
            victims also have the benefit of not being missed
            by the powers that be, though when a true vampire
            falls into the clutches of the Noddists it is usually
            the Priest who ultimately decides whom among the
            Pack deserves the reward of devouring their prey’s
            soul. Although only one may take the soul, trophies
            taken from a notable victim lend an additional grav-
            ity when the pack performs the Vaulderie or other
            communal ritae.

            The Path of Cathari
                          The Cathari are hedonists without
                       compare. Their unlives revolve around
                    pushing the limits of excess and flaunting
                    their depravity to mortal and Cainite alike.
            While to many they may seem crass and simple,
            beneath their wanton lusts lies a complex belief in
            their divine role as tempters and destroyers. Cer-

            Anarch domain. Each pack is unique, a function of
            the personalities of its members and the Paths they
            follow.

            ■   A pack devoted to the Path of Caine infiltrates
                Warsaw in secret to scout out those Cainites
                of the most desirable Blood and target them
                for diablerie, while a fellow pack seeks out and
                recovers artifacts dating back to the First City
                that hot war allies use to bring low the Prince of
                Vilnius.
            ■   A pack devoted to the Path of Cathari tears
                through New York City in an orgy of mindless
                violence, with no goal except satiating their most
                decadent desires, and their bloody games shatter
                the Masquerade – so much the better. A fellow
                pack infiltrates the city to radicalize its malcon-
                tents, at once to recruit new ranks and harry the
                repair of the Masquerade.
            ■   A pack whose members follow the Path of Power
                and the Inner Voice might use techniques either
                subtle or gross. Such a pack might infiltrate the
                domain with the goal of usurping its existing
                power structures... or it might roar into town on
                a fleet of motorcycles, looking for mortals it can

                    From the Sabbat perspective, clan is an explicit                  Of course, Sabbat will eagerly exploit rivals’
                    legacy of the influence of the Antediluvians. With-           banes (whether inside the sect or without) or credit

                    despised progenitors.                                         are undeniable properties of the Blood.

                    never celebrated. Even for the visibly obvious Sabbat         emerged from founders who turned their backs on
                    Nosferatu, other Sabbat just don’t care about the             the Dark Father. Black Hand converts from other
                    distinction.                                                  sects may react with especial vitriol, to make a point
                        Where members of other sects may consider                 of having turned away from what they once were
                    themselves in terms of clan, Sabbat members almost            – often as much to convince themselves of the cor-

                    Thus, the philosophy of antitribu, or “anti-clans.”               Unsurprisingly, this often makes it difficult for
                    On those rare occasions when lineage comes into               Sabbat vampires to hide among other sects. The

                    POSTHUMANISM AND THE SWORD OF CAINE
                    Another reason for the sect’s indifference to clan affiliation arises from its
                    elevation of Caine from “semi-mythical patriarch” to the status of “conquering
                    blood-god,” and when younger Sabbat identify as members of the Black Hand,
                    it’s the hand of Caine to which they refer. The four most recognized Paths that
                    dominate the sect at present disagree on numerous philosophical points, but they
                    are united in their beliefs about the absolute inferiority of mortals to the childer
                    of Caine.
                         To say a Sabbat looks at the kine as a farmer looks at his cows is inaccurate,
                    because at least the farmers must tend to their herds and see that the cattle live
                    and remain healthy until it’s time for the slaughter. It is more accurate to com-
                    pare the Sabbat to a shiver of sharks making its way through a prosperous reef.
                    If the sharks grow hungry – and sharks are always hungry – they simply choose
                    adequate prey, devour the edible bits, and let the savaged remains sink to the
                    bottom.
                         In this context, Sabbat philosophy is inherently posthuman. The Embrace is
                    the mechanism by which prey are elevated into apex predators. Such an elevation
                    does nothing to affect the predator-prey relationship save to reassign which of
                    the two roles that a new inductee will play.
                         For this reason, what appears as wanton cruelty toward the kine is an essen-
                    tial part of Sabbat existence. When two rival packs agree to have a spot of fun by
                    playing rugby with some mortal’s severed head as the ball, it’s not an example of
                    Cainites acting the part of monstrous edgelords. Well, it’s not just that. It is also
                    a reification of a central part of Sabbat philosophy: the idea that mortals simply
                    don’t matter at all except for when they provide some transitory benefit to their
                    betters.

                   Catechism:
                Sabbat Objectives
            To those vampires outside the Sabbat, the sect is as
            mystifying as it is terrifying. The Black Hand has
            never been particularly interested in compromise
            with other sects. Thus, most Camarilla and Anarch
            Kindred might be forgiven for wondering about the
            Sabbat’s agenda. “What do they really want?”
                To oversimplify, what the Sabbat wants is free-
            dom: complete and total freedom.
                This obsessive desire for total personal freedom
            at the expense of every other possible consideration
            starts (and arguably ends) with the Antediluvians.
            Sabbat dogma holds that not only are the Antedi-
            luvians real, they are gods in every way that mat-
            ters. Worse, they are not loving deities, but rather
            cannibal blood gods who see all lesser Cainites
            as food and nothing more. That this means the
            Antediluvians look upon the Sabbat in exactly the
            same way that much of the sect regards mortals is
            an irony best left unacknowledged. In any case, if
            the Antediluvians rise and cannot be stopped, they
            will exterminate all Cainites, if not all life, from this
            world. When one is tasked with killing an entire
            pantheon of gods, anything less than total devotion
            and total ruthlessness is a luxury.                              Ideological Enmity

                Rarely encountered on active duty, the scholar’s
            role has myriad incarnations, from de-facto leader
            to a ridiculed Poindexter savant. Some Necronomist
            Packs consist of nothing but scholars, though they
            usually share other roles as well.

            Kindred encountering Sabbat are more likely to
            run into the creations of scholars than the scholars
            themselves, either in the form of the rest of the
            pack acting on their intelligence or by falling into
            any number of traps or stratagems, supernatural or
            otherwise. If cornered, scholars tend to have machi-
            nations in place that yield them a quick final death,
            taking as many enemies as they can with them.

            Procurer
            From pimps and fixers to smugglers and engineers,
            dedicated procurers are the closest thing the Sabbat
            has to logistics. Examples include honey-tongued
            Cathari dealers, snatch-and-grab Noddist plunder-
            ers, and despotic Unifier gang lieutenants. Only the
            Reapers can afford to ignore this job, and they often
            rely on servants or creations for most of their needs.
                Since a procurer’s “goods” are just as likely to
            need to breathe as sit quietly on store shelves, many
            procurers are also adept at dealing with mortals, as
            most packs understand the value of a being behind a
            locked door before the screaming starts.

            IN STORIES:
            Dealing with vessels and vendors, procurers are
            often in a position to make unlife difficult for
            Kindred wanting to minimize mortal involvement.
            If confronted, they have no problems sacrificing
            erstwhile goods to gain the upper hand, and being
            streetwise by necessity, they’re usually one step
            ahead of anyone who decides to ignore collateral
            damage. ■

  Chapter Four: The Gehenna War




                                   Brazil: Civil War
                   Yeah, I used to run with the Sabbat.            While the Priests and Bishops were set-
                   Well, not exactly with. Hauled my ass           ting the trap, no one paid any atten-
                   out of the Creation Rites, but got              tion to— look, no one was cleaning up
                   knocked into the dirtnap pretty quick           after all the fallback actions or from
                   afterward. When I woke up, everything           the mass-grave time bombs the Black
                   was different. I just laid low and hung         Hand left in its retreats.
                   around at the edges. Gotta be careful.             Let me be honest: It’s crawling with
                   Still, things are changing fast, and            thin-bloods here. Usually these fucks

                   down. What year is it? I guess I’ve             getting themselves torn apart by Be-

                   years or so.                                    it’s different here now. They’re running
                      Whole place used to be a battle-             some Cult of the Sun or some nonsense
                   ground between the Sabbat and Camaril-          and they’re putting the Bite on “Broth-
                   la. Rio, São Paulo, Brasilia, you name          ers and Sisters” they’re supposed to be

                   shadow war, trying to play against the          marilla and to kick the Anarchs into
                   Ivory Tower on its own terms, the Cama-         line.
                   rilla has moved in with a vengeance.               Don’t get all worked up, I don’t want
                      Don’t think of it as lost domain,            any part of any of it.
                   though. That shit’s a sucker’s game.               But to hear them tell it, they’re
                   That’s how you get stasis, endlessly            tired of being fucked over. They’re
                   thinking about how to push that pretend         tired of being abandoned or being the
                   territory line further out, or who’s            canaries in the coal mine, and they
                   trying to push yours back.                      know just what kind of Blood is down
                      Look at what matters: This is one of         here for the taking and they don’t care
                   the original cradles of civilization.           who they take it from.
                   You’d shit blood for a week if you knew            It’s bad, man. Lines’ve been drawn.

                   here. How all those Camarilla courts            pires with death magics beyond the ken,
                   filling in the vacuum are just more             and while you’re trying to put them

                      That’s what the Sabbat’s here for.           Sun-worshippers taking your kill from

  Chapter Four: The Gehenna War




                            Russia and the Baltics

                           To the Undisputed Baron of Whatever You’re Calling the Domain
                           Tonight:
                           Been following up on that request for more info on Licks Un-
                           known we talked about a few months ago.
                           Sorry this took so long. Mistakes were made. Let me explain.
                           Contacts in Kyiv, Tallinn, and Riga were watching the same
                           thing we were. Spikes in "itinerant Kindred" populations
                           through late summer all the way through autumn, and with
                           those spikes an uptick in domain violence. No reason to sug-
                           arcoat it; Riga got hairy for a while, not that I give a shit
                           when some Camarilla court gets gutted. That’s nice smoke to
                           see.
                           Back to the point, though.
                           We thought they were fellow Anarchs following mortal pat-
                           terns of refugee migration. That was mistake number one. They
                           weren’t. Those Licks were migrating, all right, but not how
                           we assumed they were.
                           A few fellow veterans from the Yugoslav disintegration con-
                           firmed some of the iconography of that era still being used
                           that we saw moving through airports and other transpo cent-
                           ers. Black hands, fire symbols, variations on folk-magic sym-
                           bology.
                           And numbers would swell between security checkpoints. Eight
                           moving up through Bucharest, twelve observed in Moldova as
                           part of the same group, twenty-plus by the time they got to
                           Odessa, but still the same group.
                           Sabbat, filling ranks.
                           And you know as well as I that they don’t just "pick up"
                           Kindred here and there. If there were twenty by Odessa, who
                           knows how many they’re leaving behind them, still buried,
                           ash, or sleepers?
                           Usually that means somebody’s about to wake up for the night
                           facing a crusade. Nobody’s an expert on this shit, but Sabbat
                           don’t Embrace for love or loneliness. They Embrace to ram-
                           page.
                           Mistake number two: not a crusade, despite all evidence to
                           the contrary.
                           By this point, we were biting our nails. Who’s the target?
                           The alternative media following in the path of this is a
                           nightmare to cover up. We can keep it out of the newspapers

                  and off the news shows, but the shares on social networking
                  sites and video archives are graphic and... well, weird. I’ve
                  been killing people and drinking their blood for decades, and
                  even before that I did a few ugly favors for a few ugly - but
                  well-placed - Balkan "influencers," and this is shit even I
                  don’t want to see. And you know as well as I do that the more
                  distinct it gets, the more hunters’ eyes it attracts.
                  Then it hits me: it is a migratory pattern, but not a mortal
                  one and not a crusade. It’s a retreat. Whatever’s happen-
                  ing in the Middle East, wherever these Black Hand shitbags
                  are chasing the elders who have heard the Beckoning, all of
                  the sudden they’re running from something, moving up through
                  Eastern Europe to do it, and into Russia.
                  Remember, though, my Baltic contacts confirm similar movement
                  through their regions. So I put the pins in my murder-board,
                  and the lines are getting fatter the more they move east, the
                  more they pick up membership. And the vector is starting to
                  converge.
                  I have fewer contacts the further east things go, and eve-
                  rything dries up for me beyond an imaginary angle you could
                  draw connecting St. Petersburg, Novgorod, and Donetsk.
                  Full disclosure, I’ve lost track of them, probably fifty-
                  strong by this point, and I’m sure this wasn’t a one-off.
                  I’m sure other groups are moving as well, but I was too busy
                  watching this particular pack to keep an eye open for others.
                  Mistake number three. It’s not
                  a retreat, it’s a pursuit.
                  They’re chasing something.
                  They’re chasing something into
                  what looks like it’ll probably
                  end up being Siberia.
                  Or, way worse, it’s already
                  there and they’re converging on
                  it.
                  I’m guessing they found some-
                  thing big. Big and old. Big and
                  old and hateful.
                  We need to figure out what to
                  do next. Because I’m not go-
                  ing to sit around and wait for
                  whatever this is to pour hell-
                  fire on us.

                           The Maghreb and Alamut
                   I cannot but faithfully report what the rafiqs have             are the nights of the Second Inquisition, a return of

                   or even how they might be accomplished. These are               the drop of blood from which the growing stain
                   the things that would frighten folk of a more super-            emanates. And everywhere we look, the spread is

                   but found instead a place where thought itself had
                   become strange.
                        Not just Alamut bears these burdens. Our ghuls

            Accord
            Domains in accord have exceptionally low Cainite
            populations, as most of the vampires Embraced
            during the surge have moved on to the fronts of the
            hot conflicts of the Gehenna War. Cities in accord
            have vampire populations notably below even the
            average of Kindred-to-mortal ratios. Sabbat pres-
            ence in these cities exists mostly for the purposes of
            supporting the war effort or complicating claims
            of praxis by neighbors who might turn acquisitive
            eyes toward them. Few Camarilla luminaries would
            suffer qualms about seizing inadequately defended
            Sabbat territory, and many Anarch Barons have be-
            come so by “liberating” Sabbat domains in accord.
                In accord, the Sabbat vampires in a given
            domain are usually high-ranking figures in the sect
            hierarchy. In practice, for certain remote domains,
            this can mean literally one eminent Cainite per do-
            main, or even a single figurehead claiming authority
            over multiple proximate domains. For example, the
            Bishop of Vilnius or the Archbishop of Lima and
            Cusco, or Archbishop Lucita of Madrid.
                The majority of Sabbat domains spend most of
            their time in accord.


            Entente
            Entente domains are probably the most familiar to
            Kindred of other sects: Numerous vampires of the
            ascendant sect are present, each with some inter-
            est or personal holding in which they participate.
            That’s where such similarity ends, as prominent
            Sabbat rarely have subtle and deeply rooted influ-
            ence in a domain’s engines of industry. It all comes
            back to the blood for most Sabbat, whose interests
            lie in mortal herds and chattel for when a surge
            begins. Rare are the Sabbat minions deeply embed-
            ded in corporate boardrooms, but Sabbat Cainites
            themselves have eyes on the cargo dispatches,
            airports, and docks, and anywhere transient popula-
            tions can be easily recruited into the Gehenna War.
                 For a new Cainite in an entente domain, this is
            where a great deal of Black Hand indoctrination
            occurs. For every sociopathic Sabbat who relishes
